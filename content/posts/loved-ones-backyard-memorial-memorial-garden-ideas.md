Outcomes of Creative Ideas: What happens when you use creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be really helpful in terms of solving problems or improving the quality of a product or service. However, they can also have negative outcomes if not used correctly. Here are five tips to get the most out of creative ideas:
1. Make sure your ideas are sound. It’s impossible to come up with great ideas without some form of understanding what you’re trying to achieve. Make sure your concepts are clear, executable, and likely to work in practice.

2. Take a step back first. While it may be tempting to take things one step further and come up with something truly unique, doing so could actually backfire if it doesn’t have a real bearing on the problem at hand.
