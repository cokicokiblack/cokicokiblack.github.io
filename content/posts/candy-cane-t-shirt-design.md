Winter weather: Tips to keep your home warm
If you're like most people, you probably think of winter as the time when your house is cold and unused. But that's not always the case. In fact, there are a few things you can do to keep your home warm during the winter. Here are some tips:
1) Keep your windows open at all times. This will let in natural sunlight, which will help keep your home warm.
2) Use a fireplace or heat pad. Fires add warmth to any space, and they also emit noxious gases which can help block out wind noise and cold air from coming in.
3) Place an electric blanket over every piece of furniture in your room. This will place an electric field between yourself and the elements, which will help keep you warm (or cooler) during the winter months.

The Benefits of Innovation: What are the benefits for businesses and individuals?
New technologies, such as those that allow businesses to make changes in their products or services without having to go through traditional marketing or product development processes, are often associated with benefits for the business and individual stakeholder groups alike. These new technologies can provide businesses with new markets and customers, faster turnaround times for products or services, increased efficiency and productivity, and new opportunities for innovation. In some cases, these advantages can even lead to competitive advantages over older rivals.
While there are a number of benefits associated with innovation (including creating jobs and boost the economy), it can also have negative effects on businesses if not managed properly. For example, when a company begins using a new technology incorrectly or does not properly validate its results before implementing them in the marketplace, it can result in negative publicity and decreased sales.
