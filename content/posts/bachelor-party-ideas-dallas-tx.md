Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.

The need for innovation
In the business world, the one thing that is always constant is change. In order to stay ahead of the competition, businesses need to be constantly innovating. They need to be looking for new ways to do things, new products to sell, and new services to offer.
Innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas, it’s about implementing those ideas and making them a reality. It’s about taking risks and being willing to fail. It’s about being able to think outside the box and challenge the status quo.

If businesses want to stay relevant and competitive, they need to embrace innovation. It’s no longer an option, it’s a necessity.
