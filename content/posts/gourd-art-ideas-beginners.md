Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples: 
1. Make a DIY painting project: Start by picking the colors you want and drawing the basic shapes for your painting using pencil and paper. Once you have a basic idea, just start painting! You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors. 

2. Build an Ikea chest: This is another great way to do a project without any tools! All you need is some wood screws and nails, some light-tricks (like X-acto knives), and some sandpaper (if needed).
