Economic Applications of Invention
Invention has a broad range of economic applications, from making new products to improving the efficiency of businesses. Inventions can also have a significant impact on the economy as a whole, depending on their potential uses and impacts. Here are some examples: 
1. Invention can help improve the quality of products. For example, an invention that makes products more healthy or less risky could lead to increased sales and reduce risks associated with manufacturing processes. 
2. Invention can help increase efficiency in businesses. For example, an invention that makes it easier to track expenses or get information from suppliers could lead to faster delivery times and reduced costs for businesses. 
3. Invention can create new markets for products or services. For example, an invention that creates a new type of clothing could bring in new customers and make it more difficult for rivals to compete against him/her.

Inventors and their ideas
Invention is the backbone of progress. It has led to the creation of entire industries and propelled humanity forward. But what drives someone to become an inventor?
For most people, it starts with a problem that they want to solve. They see something that doesn't work the way it should or could be improved, and they set out to create a solution. In some cases, the invention is born out of necessity; in others, it's simply a matter of wanting to make something better.

Whatever the motivation, all great inventions start with an idea. And behind every great idea is an inventive mind at work.

Creative problem-solving:

Ideas in Action: How to start using your ideas
How to start using your ideas? It can be difficult finding the right inspiration, but with a little effort and creativity, you can get started on anything. Here are three ways to get started: 
1. Take a walk: Spending time outside is always a great way to think about new ideas. When you’re fresh and unafraid of new challenges, you may be more inspired to come up with new solutions. 
2. Draw inspiration from others: Not all ideas need an original solution, but looking at other people’s successes or failures can be inspiring. This will help you see what works and what doesn’t in your own business. 
3. Get help: There are plenty of resources available online and in books that can help you brainstorm and come up with new ideas.
