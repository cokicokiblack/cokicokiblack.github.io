Technology Transfer: What are some ways that an inventor can get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product?
Inventors often need to get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product in order to make a profit. There are many ways that an inventor can do this. Some ways include: 
1. Contact companies who make access to new technology difficult. This could be done by contacting companies who make it difficult for others to get access to new technology, such as those who control the patents and copyrights for the technology. 
2. Contact tech companies who make it difficult for others to bring new technology to market. These tech companies might include those that produce computer viruses, those that produce software that is difficult to uninstall, or those that make it difficult for others to find information about new technologies. 
3. Get involved with technical societies and technology groups who specialize in promoting new technologies.

Invention life cycle: From idea to market debut
Invention life cycle is a process that starts with the idea and ends with the product in people's hands. The process begins with brainstorming, which is where ideas are shared and discussed. Next, there’s developing the idea, which can involve researching and coming up with proofs of concept. Once the idea is developed, it needs to be tested and validated to see if it can be turned into a reality. Lastly, there’s marketing and distribution to let people know about the product.
