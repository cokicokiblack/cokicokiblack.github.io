The science of creativity
A person's creativity is often thought of as a mysterious quality that cannot be measured or studied. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests otherwise. The science of creativity is an interdisciplinary field that examines the nature and development of creative abilities.
While there is no single definition of creativity, it is generally defined as the ability to produce new and innovative ideas. Creativity is often seen as a rare or elusive quality, but recent research suggests that it is more common than previously thought.

There are many different factors that contribute to creativity. Some of these include intelligence, genes, environment, and motivation. However, one of the most important aspects of creativity is divergent thinking. This is the ability to come up with multiple solutions to a problem or multiple ways to approach a task.

How to Come up with Creative Ideas
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but it can be hard to come up with them. There are a few things that help: having an idea, brainstorming, testing, and iteration. 
Here are some tips for coming up with creative ideas:

1. Brainstorm - Brainstorming is key to coming up with new ideas. Start by thinking about the problem you want to solve and how you can improve on what's already out there. What are the possible solutions? 
2. Test - Once you've generated some brainstorm fodder, it's time to test it out. Do something different or innovative with it and see if it works or not. This will help you get a better understanding of how your idea works and what problems might need to be solved in order for it to work well.
