brainstorming: What is a good way to come up with new invention ideas?
brainstorming is a process of ideas generation in which people gather input and come up with new ways to do things. It can be used for everything from developing new products to coming up with new ways to win contests. There are a number of different brainstorming tools available, but the most popular ones are the group home, online chat, and creative problem-solving tools. 
One way to come up with new invention ideas is to use brainstorming tools as part of a collaborative environment. Groups can work together to come up with solutions to problems or come up with new ideas for products. This can be a great way for groups to get creative and share their ideas. If you don't have any brainstorming tools at home, there are plenty of online resources available that can help you get started.
