How to come up with big ideas
If you're looking for big ideas, the best way to come up with them is by brainstorming. It's an effective way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new ways to think about problems or possibilities. If you're not sure how to do this, here are some tips:
1. Start by thinking about what you know. What are some of the things that have bedeviled you in the past? What have been some of your biggest challenges? Once you've gathered these information, it's time to start brainstorming potential solutions.

2. Be open-minded. Don't be afraid to change your mind if something comes up during your brainstorming session. After all, creativity is a risky business - it might be fun or it might not work - so don't be afraid to experiment!

Patenting an invention: How do you patent an invention?
Patenting an invention is a process of filing a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This application can be filed in many different forms, but it is most commonly filed as a ‚Äúpatent application.‚Äù
When you file your patent application, you will need to provide a detailed description of your invention. This description will need to include everything from your name and contact information to the inventions that you are claiming. You will also need to provide enough evidence to support your claims.

Once you have submitted your patent application, the USPTO will review it and make any decisions necessary for approval. Once the USPTO approves your patent, you will then have to receive permission from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to sell or offer for sale your invention.
