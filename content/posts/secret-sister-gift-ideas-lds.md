Definition: Innovation is the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created.
definition of innovation
One of the key concepts in innovation is the definition of what it is. Innovation can be defined as the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created. This definition could be used to describe many different aspects of innovation, but some are more important than others. For example, innovation can be used to describe the process by which new products are created, or the process by which new ideas are developed.

There's also the option of learning from experts and watching them create innovative products or services.
