Definition of creativity: How does it differ from ordinary thinking?

Invention ideas are everywhere
Invention ideas are everywhere. You just have to be open to them. Most people go through life without ever thinking about inventing something, but the truth is that anyone can do it. All it takes is a little bit of creativity and a willingness to think outside the box.
If you're looking for invention ideas, start by taking a look at the things around you that could be improved. What annoys you on a daily basis? What would make your life easier? Chances are, there are others out there who feel the same way and would love to use your invention.

Another great place to find invention ideas is by talking to people. Ask them about the problems they face on a daily basis. What do they wish they had that would make their lives easier? You may be surprised at how many people have great ideas for inventions but never act on them.

The Future of Education: What will be the future of education?
The future of education is a question that has been asked for centuries and will continue to be asked in the coming years. Many different ideas have been proposed as to what the future of education should be, but no one single answer has emerged as the definitive answer. Some possible answers include: 
"Equality of opportunity" 
"Universal Basic Education" 
"Teacher training programs for all skill levels" 
" computer-assisted learning "
In terms of ideas, the most likely answer would be a form of universal basic education. This would provide all citizens with equal access to education, regardless of their economic status or educational qualifications. Another idea that has been proposed is teacher training programs for all skill levels. This would allow people of all skill levels to learn how to teach, which would then help reduce teaching costs and improve overall school quality.

The goal is to come up with as many ideas as possible, without worrying about whether they're good or not. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can start to narrow them down.
