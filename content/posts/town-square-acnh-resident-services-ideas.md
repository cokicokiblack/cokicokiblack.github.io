Definition of a big idea:
Big ideas are those that are so big and complex that they take up a lot of space in a piece, but are actually very easy to understand and implement. Some big ideas may be things like global warming, energy independence, or creating a more perfect society. Regardless of the complexity of the idea, it should be easy to understand why it is important and what could happen if it were implemented.

Origins and definition of art: How does art start?
Creative art is the act or process of creating art through the use of creativity. There are many definition for art, but one that stands out the most is that it starts with the individual’s idea and then grows into something else. For example, a painting may start as an Impressionist sketch and grow into a full-blown painting. The definition changes with every artist, but the idea of creativity remains the same.
