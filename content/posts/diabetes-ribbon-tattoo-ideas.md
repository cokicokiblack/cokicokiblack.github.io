Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.

What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.

Why creativity is important: What does it mean for business and life?
Creativity is important for business and life. It can mean new ideas, coming up with new ways to do things, or simply a different perspective on an old problem. In most cases, creativity is essential for businesses and people to continue their momentum and grow in their careers. However, it can also be dangerous to rely exclusively on creativity alone to solve problems, as it can quickly become exhausted and stale. There are a few factors that help to keep creativity fresh and ongoing, and these are key to success in any field: having a diverse range of ideas, keeping our imaginations active by letting them roam free, developing our creative abilities over time, being comfortable with risk and uncertainty, and always looking for ways to improve upon what we’ve done before.
