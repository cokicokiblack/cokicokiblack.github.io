Inventors and their ideas
Invention is the backbone of progress. It has led to the creation of entire industries and propelled humanity forward. But what drives someone to become an inventor?
For most people, it starts with a problem that they want to solve. They see something that doesn't work the way it should or could be improved, and they set out to create a solution. In some cases, the invention is born out of necessity; in others, it's simply a matter of wanting to make something better.

Whatever the motivation, all great inventions start with an idea. And behind every great idea is an inventive mind at work.

getting feedback: How do you get feedback for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get feedback for your work. However, getting feedback can be difficult. There are a number of ways to get feedback and it depends on the person you are talking to. Here are some tips:
1. Take notes when you have thoughts or ideas. This will help you remember what you want to say later and also give you feedback on how your idea is sounding.

2. Get someone else to listen to your ideas. If you only have yourself to talk to, it can be tough getting feedback because it may not be clear what is wanted from the conversation. Get someone else who will understand the idea and can give feedback that is helpful.

3. Talk about your ideas with others before starting anything new.
