The Future of Education: What changes need to be made to education in order to keep up with the changing world?
Education has always been a important part of society, but in recent years there have been significant changes taking place in the world that need to be made in order to keep up with the changing world. One such change is the increasing use of technology in education. As technology becomes more prevalent and accessible, it is becoming easier for students and educators to connect with each other and learn from each other. This way, it is possible for students to learn at their own pace and for educators to teach different types of courses that are necessary for today's economy.

The benefits of big ideas
Big Ideas can have a significant impact on people’s lives and the world around them. By sharing great ideas with the world, we can help make a positive change. Here are 5 of the best big ideas around: 
1. Let people know their options – large groups of people can be very intimidating, especially if you don’t have an idea for something. Let them know there are many different ways to solve a problem and that they don’t have to choose one. This will open their eyes and give them more options. 
2. Give people power – often times, the most important thing is giving people control over their lives in some way shape or form. In order to do this, you need to share your idea with as many people as possible so that everyone has an equal say in what happens next.

The four steps to creating ideas: problem solving, coming up with a good title, writing a proposal, and taking action.
1. Get clear about what you want to achieve. What are your goals? What is the problem that you want to solve? 
2. Brainstorm a group of people who can help you develop your ideas. This can be a group of friends, family, or co-workers.

4. Write out your proposal for potential investors or clients. This will give them a detailed account of what you plan to do and why it’s important for them to invest in your project.
