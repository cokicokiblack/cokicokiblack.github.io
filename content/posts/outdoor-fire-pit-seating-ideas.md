Defining ideas
When it comes to ideas, there is no one-size-fits-all definition. Ideas can come in many different forms, and they can be used for a variety of purposes.
Some people might think of ideas as being nothing more than a thought or concept. Others might see them as being something that can be turned into a reality. Whatever your definition of ideas may be, there is no doubt that they are important.

Ideas can be the spark that starts a fire, or they can be the key to solving a problem. They can be the foundation for a new business or product, or they can simply help you see the world in a new way. No matter what their purpose is, ideas are essential for driving innovation and change.

How to be more creative
Creativity is key to any successful career. If you can find ways to be more creative, your work will be more valuable and you'll be able to achieve your goals. Here are some tips on how to become more creative: 
1. Make time for yourself. When you're not working, take a break or do something that's outside of your regular routine. This will help you get away from the stress of the day and come back with fresh ideas.

3. Be open to change. Change is Key To Creative Processes!
