Definition of innovation: A new way of doing things
Innovation is the alteration of the way something is done, or the creation of a new product or service. Innovation can be seen as a way to improve efficiency, lower costs, create new products and services, or to solve problems that have been unsolved. Over time, innovation has become an essential part of technological progress and has led to advances in a variety of industries.
There are several definitions of innovation that are used by different groups and individuals. One definition is "the process by which new ideas, products or services are created." This definition includes both the idea that innovation takes place in addition to existing technologies, as well as the idea that it is not limited to any one sector but can encompass a wide range of industries. Another definition is "a sudden change in state from one having existed for some time before" which could refer to changes in business models or technology.
