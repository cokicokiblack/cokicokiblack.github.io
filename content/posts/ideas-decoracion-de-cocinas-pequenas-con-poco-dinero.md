Different types of innovation:
Innovation is a key term in business. It can be defined as the process of making something new and better. There are many types of innovation, some of which are more common than others. 
One type of innovation is product innovation. This refers to the development of a new product that does not already exist. In this case, the company must come up with a new way to make their product and market it to customers.

Finally, there is service innovation. This refers to the development of new services that could not be produced by companies alone, such as software development or customer service.

Innovation in healthcare: What new technologies are coming soon?
The healthcare industry is constantly developing new technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of care. Some of these innovations are coming soon, while others may still take some time to develop. Here are two examples of the latter. 
One technology is called "smart technology." This refers to devices that are specifically designed to improve patient care, such as providing real-time alerts or tracking patient vital signs.
