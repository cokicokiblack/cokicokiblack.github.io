The dangers of big ideas
Most people think of big ideas as being a good thing. After all, they’re the things that change the world. But there is a downside to having big ideas. They can be dangerous.
For one thing, big ideas are often disruptive. They can upend established ways of doing things and create chaos in the process. That’s not always a bad thing, but it can be. And even when it leads to positive change, it can be difficult and painful for those who are caught in the middle of it.

Another danger of big ideas is that they can be overwhelming. When we’re faced with a big problem, it can be tempting to try to solve it with a single, grand solution. But that rarely works out well. Complex problems usually require multiple smaller solutions working together.

Although creativity is often thought of as a tool that can be used for good, it can also be used to create harmful or negative ideas. For example, someone who is creative may come up with a new way to cook an egg, but if this person then starts to eat eggs out of the frying pan every day, they may begin to develop an egg-eating disorder.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
