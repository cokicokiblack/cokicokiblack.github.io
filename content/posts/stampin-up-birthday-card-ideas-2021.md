How do inventors go about coming up with new inventions?
Invention ideas are one of the most important aspects of any inventor's toolkit. They can be used to solve problems or make new products. However, coming up with new inventions can be difficult. There are many ways to come up with new inventions, but the most important thing is to think of a solution that you can see happening in the future.
One way to come up with new inventions is to focus on a problem that you know people need and want solved. You can also look at industries that are in your field and see what products or services they currently use or would like to use in the future. Another way to come up with new inventions is by thinking outside the box. You can develop a product idea that isn't currently being used or marketed. This will give you an idea for how you could make your product stand out from the competition.

What are some 2020 ideas?
2020 is a year of opportunity. It's a time to think about what we can do to make our world a better place. Here are two ideas that could help: 
The first is the United Nations' " Agenda 21 ," which calls for creating an international body to focus on sustainable development. This would be a great way to bring together different groups of people who have something to say about how the world should be run, and it would also be a good way to learn from other countries. 
The second is the Global Compact on climate change, which was started in 2014 by more than 190 countries. The idea behind it is that all countries must take steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or less. This would mean reducing emissions from industries and buildings, improving energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy sources.

This is done by using a logical thinking process and using what is known as cognitive dissonance.
