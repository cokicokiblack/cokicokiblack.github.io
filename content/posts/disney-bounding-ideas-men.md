What is an invention?
Inventions are products or services that improve the lives of people. They can be small or large, simple or complex. There are many types of inventions, but some common ones include cars, computers, and mobile phones. Some people say that invention is the process of coming up with a new idea. Others say it’s when a person produces a new product or service that does not exist before. It’s important to remember that an invention is not just one idea; it’s a product or service that gets put into production and helps people in some way.
