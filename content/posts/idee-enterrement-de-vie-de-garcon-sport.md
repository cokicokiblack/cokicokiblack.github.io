Section 5: Outdoorsy DIY Projects
Outdoorsy people are always looking for new ways to spruce up their yards and gardens. Here are a few DIY ideas that will add personality and charm to any outdoor space.
1. A simple birdhouse can be made out of an old milk carton or oatmeal container. Just cut out a hole for the entrance, add some perches inside, and decorate the outside however you like.

Economic analysis: What factors should you consider when developing an invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the seemingly simple to the incredibly complex. To make sure your invention is ripe for commercialization, you'll need to consider a variety of factors: cost, potential market demand, and other key considerations. Here are three tips to help you develop an idea that will be successful: 
1. Consider the costs of developing your invention. While it's important to come up with a reasonable price point for your product or service, don't forget about marketing and promotion costs – these can be significant expenses if you want your product to be successful. Look at how much money you think it would take to generate interest in your product or service and figure out how much marketing and promotional budget you'll need based on that information.

2. Consider potential market demand.

The Importance of New Ideas: What would be the consequences of not having any?
The importance of new ideas is often overstated, but without them, society would be in a very different place. Not having any new ideas means that the world would be more stagnate and uninteresting. This lack of innovation could have serious consequences for our economy and society as a whole.
