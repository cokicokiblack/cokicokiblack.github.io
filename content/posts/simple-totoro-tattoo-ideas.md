The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.

Trends for Work/Life Balance
In the next few years, many people are looking for ways to balance work and personal lives. Here are some ideas for ways to make work life easier for everyone: 1. Make work a non-essential part of your day. This means that you should only be working when it is necessary and from what you are best suited for. If you have time off during the week, use it to take care of yourself or do something that you enjoy. 2. Try using technology instead of avoiding it. Technology can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it also can keep you from getting too involved with work. Make sure to set boundaries so that your time on the computer is only used for necessary tasks and not idle chat or gaming. 3. Find a job that fit both your skills and interests.
