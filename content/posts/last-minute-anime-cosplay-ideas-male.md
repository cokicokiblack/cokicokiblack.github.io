Innovation is a key concept in business. It allows businesses to change and improve their products and services in order to meet customer needs.

In the medical field, innovations such as vaccines and artificial intelligence can help doctors diagnose and treat patients faster. Businesses can also use innovation to increase their profits.

Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.
