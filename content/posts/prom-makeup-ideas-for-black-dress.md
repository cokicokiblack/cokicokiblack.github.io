Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that wasn't already in existence. Invention often takes place in the form of a new idea, design, or technology. It can also come from scratch, during the development of a new product. Many inventions are made for commercial reasons, such as making a new product that is more affordable or easier to use.

The 5 Types of Ideas: Creative, Strategic, Normative, Primal, and Vague.
Creative ideas can be anything, but they typically fall into one of five types: strategic, normative, Primal, and vague. 
Strategic ideas are those that focus on the overall strategy of a project or organization. Normative ideas deal with how things should be done in order to achieve a certain result. Primal ideas are the raw materials that creative minds start with and use to come up with new and innovative ways to do things. Vague ideas are those that are too general or abstract for anyone to really understand them without more information.
