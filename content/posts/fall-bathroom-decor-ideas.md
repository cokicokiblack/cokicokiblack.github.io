Concepts behind plot and story: What are the elements of a good story?
Plot is the story's backbone, and without a plot, stories are essentially empty vessels. Storytelling has been around for centuries, and there are dozens of different concepts that contribute to a good story. Here are a few key ones:
1) Characters: What makes a good character? Is he or she likable, believable, and relatable? Are they in control of their own lives and choices? Are they interesting enough to follow along with the story?

2) Plot: How does the story go from start to finish? Is it chronological, or does it go in reverse or hops around like an L.A. law student on a bender? Are there any side stories that play into the main plotline? And how important is the climax/ending to the story?
