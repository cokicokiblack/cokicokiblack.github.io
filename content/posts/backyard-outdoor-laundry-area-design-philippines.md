What is brainstroming?
Are you feeling overwhelmed and lost? If so, you may be experiencing brainstroming. Brainstroming is a phenomena that occurs when one is overwhelmed and cannot think of anything to focus on. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, stress, and confusion. There are a few things that can help to improve your mental state while suffering from brainstroming. First, try focusing on why you are feeling overwhelmed. This could be as simple as identifying a specific task that you need to complete in order to feel better, or thinking about what others have said or done that has made you feel this way. Additionally, break down the task into smaller goals rather than trying to do the entire thing at once. Doing small tasks multiple times throughout the day will help keep your mind off of the larger issues at hand and will make it easier to stay focused on your goals.
