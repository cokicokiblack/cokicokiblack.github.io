Creative juices: How creativity flows through our veins
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. It can help us see things in a new way, inspire us to create, and connect with others. But just how creativity flows through our veins? And what role does it play in our lives?
According to a study by University of Edinburgh researchers, creativity is passed down from parents to children through their blood pressure levels. When the parents had high blood pressure levels, they were more creative than when they had low blood pressure levels. This finding suggests that creativity is a natural part of human nature and can be passed down through the generations.

Other studies have also shown that creativity is connected with stress levels. If people are under stress, they are less creative than if they are not under stress. This suggests that stress can influence how creative we become.

The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

Methodology: How will we test and measure the results?
Testing and measuring the results is an important step in any business. It allows you to know how your product or service is performing and whether it is meeting your expectations. There are many different ways to test and measure the results of a business, but one common approach is to use surveys. Surveys can be used to measure customer satisfaction, abandon rates, and more.
There are a few factors you should consider when choosing a survey technique. For example, do you want to target specific demographics? Or do you want to gather data from a large number of people? Finally, will you be able to release the results publicly? If so, public Release Testing (PRT) may be the best technique for you. PRT allows you to release your findings as soon as possible after testing so that everyone can see what worked and what didn’t.

The power of creativity: What does it mean for artists?
Creativity is a key word when it comes to artists. It can mean different things to different people, but in general, creativity refers to the ability of an individual to come up with new and innovative ideas. This doesn’t just mean coming up with new ways to look at an old problem or coming up with new solutions to old problems; creativity can also be used to come up with new ways of looking at things. For example, if you were a painter and you wanted to create a painting that depicted the history of art, you might come up with something that showed how various Artists have used their creativity in order to create their work. In fact, some artists even go so far as to say that creativity is the only thing that separates them from other professional artists.
