Innovation Processes: How do inventors produce new inventions?
Invention processes vary depending on the type of invention. For example, a new food product may be developed through a research process that involves tasting and analyzing different foods to find the best ones to make. In other cases, an inventor may simply come up with an idea and then work on developing it until it becomes a reality. However, no matter what the process, innovation always starts with an inventor’s idea.

Definition of invention: What is it and what does it mean for society?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something existing. It can be anything from a new product to a new idea for a business. Inventions have a big impact on society because they can change the way we live and work. They can also create new opportunities for businesses and people.
One of the key definitions for invention is "a means of producing something which had not been produced before, or that is different from what has been produced previously." This definition encompasses everything from products to ideas to methods of transportation. Inventors are often incredibly creative and come up with amazing ideas that could change the world. Without invention, there would likely be very few innovations in our lives.

Invention has played an important role in human history since prehistoric times. For example, early humans used tools to make their way through life and get food and shelter.

The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

The definition of creativity: What does it mean for artists?
Creativity is often misunderstood and its definition can be difficult to determine. Some say creativity refers to the ability to come up with new ideas, while others define creativity as the ability to see things in a different way or express oneself through art.
