Types of innovation: What are some types of innovations that businesses commonly use?
Innovation is a process of change that leads to the creation of new products, services, or economy. There are many different types of innovation, but four common types are product innovation, service innovation, market innovation, and business model innovation. 
Product Innovation: Product innovations are changes in the physical form of something that makes it more accessible or useful to consumers. For example, Google created Street View in order to allow people to see how their cities look from close up. This type of innovation is often used for education and marketing purposes. Service Innovation: Service innovations are changes in the way services are delivered to customers. For example, Apple Watch was developed as a way for people to keep track of their time and step-by-step exercises without having to carry a phone around. This type of innovation is often used for health and fitness applications.

Ideas for fashion: What are some creative ways to wear your favorite clothes?
There are endless ways to wear your favorite clothes, whether you're dressing up for a special occasion or just looking stylish. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Try wearing Statement Clothing: These pieces are often the most eye-catching and stand out from the rest of your outfit. They can be dressed up or down, so it's always good to have a few options on hand. 
2. Get inspired by Current Trends: If you're looking for something a little more contemporary, try wearing clothing that is in keeping with the latest trends. This can include things like pants that fit tightly or skirts that flare out at the bottom. 
3. Use Laundry Supplies as Accessories: When it comes to fashion, there's nothing worse than over-indulging in superfluous accessories.
