The history of invention: From ancient times to the modern day
Invention is the act of creating a new object or idea from scratch. It has been around for centuries, and some of the most iconic inventions include the wheel, the telephone, and insulin. However, there are also some less well-known inventions that have had a significant impact on our lives. For example, the condom was invented by a man named John Hargrave in 1877. He came up with the idea after seeing a group of men fighting outside his home. He realized that if he could create a device that prevented conception then he could prevent any future fights between men and prevent them from ending in bloodshed.
