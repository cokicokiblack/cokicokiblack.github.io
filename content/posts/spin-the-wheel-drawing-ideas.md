Explaining creativity in the arts: How does creativity work in the arts? Why do certain artists create different things and what is the difference between creative and non-creative art?
Creativity in the arts is a complex process that involves many different factors. One of the most important factors is inspiration. Inspiration comes from all around us and can be found in nature, literature, art, and any other form of creativity. However, inspiration cannot be used to create things that are not alreadyexisting. In order to create something new, someone must have an idea and then work on creating it until they reach a point where it is their own creation. This is called creativeigoration. There are many different types of creativity and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some artists prefer to use more traditional forms of creativity like brainstorming or problem solving in order to come up with new ideas, while others prefer more innovative methods such as appropriation or appropriationism. Ultimately, the key is to find what works best for you and let your creativity take over!
