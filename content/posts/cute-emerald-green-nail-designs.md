The future of education: What will be the biggest changes in education in 2022?
The future of education is shrouded in many potential changes. One of the most important changes will be the way we educate our students. In 2022, there are many ideas that could impact education in a major way. Some of these ideas include: 
1) Increased emphasis on video gaming and physical activity to improve learning: Video gaming has become increasingly popular in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. This can help children learn more quickly and efficiently, as they can get lost in the game and not have to worry about homework or other school tasks. Physical activity also has great effects on learning. Children who spend more time active have better mental health, better grades, and less anxiety. 

2) Changes to how schools are run: Many schools are currently run like businesses.
