Big ideas are the foundation of any innovation program. They can be used to generate new ideas, or to refine old ones. Some big ideas are simple, like developing a new product or service, but others are more complex, like creating a new way of doing business.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the creation of new ideas that replace or improve on the existing product, service, or system. Innovation can come from a small idea thatâ€™s implemented quickly, or it can come from a big idea thatâ€™s tackled in an effort to improve a whole product line. It can also come from the combination of two ideas, or from something new that isnâ€™t even possible before. Innovation is something that every company needs to consider when they create their products and services.

Conclusion: Why should businesses invest in innovation?
Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve and stay competitive. Innovation can be found in anything from technology to marketing. However, businesses that are Continuously Innovation-Minded will see a return on investment (ROI) much sooner than those that arenâ€™t. To be continuously innovative, businesses must have a clear idea of what they want to create and then make sure they can actually achieve it. This requires significant resources and time, but with the right attitude and strategies, businesses can reap the rewards of innovation sooner rather than later.
