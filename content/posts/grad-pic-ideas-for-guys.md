What are the challenges of having big ideas?
There are a few key challenges that come with having big ideas, according to Jason Fried. Fried is the author of The Lean Startup, a book on how to build successful startups. In his book, he discusses how it can be tough to stay creative and keep up with new ideas when your mind is constantly filled with too many thoughts. 
One challenge is that it can be hard to remember what you just thought of. Another is that it can be difficult to get your thoughts down in writing form. Finally, Fried says that it can be hard to see the big picture when you're thinking about individual products or services.
