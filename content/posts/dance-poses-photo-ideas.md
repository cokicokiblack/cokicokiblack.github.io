The History of Innovation:
Innovation is the process of expanding the boundaries of what is possible. Innovation occurs when a new idea or approach to solving a problem is proposed, and then tested and implemented. There are many different types of innovation, but some common ones include:
1. Research and development – This refers to the development of new products or services that are Pirandello-like in their concept but with real world application possibilities. It can be done through trials and prototypes, as well as product launches.

2. Creative destruction – This refers to the process by which ideas, concepts, or technologies that have been tried and failed before are resurrected and given a second chance. They may be used in combination, or they may be abandoned altogether after experiencing negative results.

Conclusion: Tips for turning your creative ideas into tangible results.
Creative ideas can be turned into tangible results with a little effort and creativity. Here are some tips to help get started: 
1. Take a step back and think about the original idea. Are you brainstorming with others to come up with new ideas? If so, take the time to answer these two questions: What is the main benefit of this idea? And is there someone who would benefit from this idea? 
2. Look at what you have already done in your creative process. Have you ever had an idea but never put it into action? Try doing something similar first and see what works best for you. This can also include coming up with a prototype or model of the idea before starting anything else. 
3. Get organized and start thinking about how you plan on implementing this idea.

What are big ideas? What are some of the most important things to remember when it comes to big ideas?
There are a few important things to remember when it comes to big ideas. The first is that ideas should be focused and specific. If they're not, they'll likely never see the light of day. Second, it's important to have a plan for execution. This will help ensure that your idea actually happens, and doesn't just languish in your head. Finally, you need some backing from others before you can start anything truly big. Without this support, it's more difficult to truly push an idea off the ground.
