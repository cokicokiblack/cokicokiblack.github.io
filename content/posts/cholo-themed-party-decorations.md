What are some bad ideas?
New ideas can be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on how they're executed. Here are some bad ideas that could lead to negative outcomes: 
1. A new law that restricts freedom of speech. This law could lead to people being arrested and/or fined for expressing their opinions out of fear of retribution from the government. 
2. A plan to close all schools in the city in order to provide more public education. This plan would deprive children of instruction and would lead to an increase in crime rates in the city. 
3. Requiring businesses owners to install security cameras inside their businesses in order to catch thieves and criminals. This would require owners to spend money on something that isn't necessary and would also create an inconvenience for customers who need access to their businesses without having their business broken into.

How inventions are created: by coming up with a creative plan or idea and then doing some trial and error
inventive ideas are created by coming up with a creative plan or idea and then doing some trial and error. Sometimes, this process can be a lot easier than you think. If you're not sure how to start your own invention journey, here are five tips to get you started. 1) Think about what you want to create. What are your goals? What do you need to succeed? Once you have these answers, come up with a creative plan that will help achieve them. This will give you a better idea of what kind of ideas work and don't work for your product or service. 2) Be persistent. If it takes longer than expected to get started, don't give up! Keep at it until the project is more successful than when you started. 3) Take your time and make sure everything is in place before starting the experiment.
