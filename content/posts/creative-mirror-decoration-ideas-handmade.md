Definition of invention:
Inventions are creative ideas that come about as a result of a person's efforts. They can be things like a new product or service, or just some new technology. Inventions can have a lot of different meanings, depending on the person who created it. For example, a clothing company might create a new style that is different from all the others out there. Or, someone might come up with a new way to make something work. There are so many different definitions for inventions, it's hard to say which one is the most accurate. But, whatever the definition may be, an invention is always something good that somebody came up with to improve the world.

Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.
