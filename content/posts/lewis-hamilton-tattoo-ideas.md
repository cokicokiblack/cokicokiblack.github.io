What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product or service that is different from the ones currently in use. Innovation can be seen in everything from medical treatments to fashion trends.
There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to innovation. The first is that innovation should be incremental, meaning that it shouldn't come from one big leap forward but rather incremental changes that improve upon the current system. Second, innovation should be based on customer feedback and not just on what someone thinks is best for their business.

What are big ideas?
There are many big ideas out there, and it can be tough to decide which ones to pursue. Here are some key tips to help you come up with the best ideas:
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. What is your target market? What are your ultimate goals? When it comes to big ideas, these questions will help you determine which ones are the most feasible and actionable.

2. Take a step back and assess the feasibility of your idea. This includes figuring out how much work it will take to make your idea a reality, how much money you’ll need to create a prototype or develop an MVP, and whether or not you have the right team in place to execute on your vision.

3. Get more input from others before finalizing your idea.
