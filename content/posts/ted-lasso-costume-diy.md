Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.

Conclusion: What are some big ideas that you came up with and how did they play out in practice?
The big ideas that were used in practice for the Vikings game on Thursday night were running back Adrian Peterson and tight end Kyle Rudolph. Peterson ran for 124 yards on 14 carries and Rudolph caught a pass for 79 yards. This showed that it is possible to run the ball effectively and have success with tight ends. These results show that big ideas can work if put into practice.
