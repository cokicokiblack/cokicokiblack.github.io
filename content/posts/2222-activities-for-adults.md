Discussion: How can we find and use the best ideas for our goals?
If you're like most people, you have some goals that you want to achieve. However, what do you do with the ideas for achieving those goals? 
There are a lot of ways to find and use the best ideas for your goals, but here are four that may be particularly helpful: 

1) Look at what others have accomplished - This is probably the simplest way to find good ideas, as it's all around us. When looking at what others have done, ask yourself how could you perform better or accomplish more of the same? What was their goal? What did they do to achieve it? You'll likely find a lot of great ideas in this category. 
2) Brainstorm - Brainstorming is another great way to come up with new ideas. Again, ask yourself why something might be an effective approach or solution.

The five types of creativity: Abstract, Imaginative, Creative, Mental, and Physical.
Creative ideas are a type of creativity that comes from different areas of the brain. The five types of creativity are abstract, imaginative, creative, mental, and physical. Abstract creativity is when an idea is without any specific details. Imagination is when an idea comes from your mind and not from reality. Creative ideas come from all different parts of the brain and can be physical or mental. Mental creativity is when you have a strong idea but do not know how to put it into words. Physical creativity comes when you come up with new ways to use old things. Finally, there is creative physicality which comes about when you create something that no one has ever thought of before.
