Invention 3: A way to store energy
Invention 3: A way to store energy. 

Energy storage has been an issue for a long time. The traditional storage methods such as fossil fuels or nuclear power are not sustainable in the long term. 
But, using renewable energy sources can solve this problem. 
There are many ways to use renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and waterpower to create electricity. However, the best option is solar. This is because it is easy to produce and reliable in the short run. 
Solar panels can be placed on roofs or in buildings, which makes them very affordable and easy to use. Moreover, they are very efficient in converting sunlight into electrical energy.

The power of creativity: How can it help you succeed?
Creativity is a powerful tool that can help you succeed in any field. By using creativity, you can come up with new ideas and strategies that can help you achieve your goals. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when using creativity as a tool: first, be realistic about what you want to achieve. Don't expect to create something overnight or from scratch; rather, use creativity as an engine to help you realize your goals. Additionally, be sure that your creative ideas are feasible and achievable. If they aren't, you may find it difficult to implement them into reality. Finally, don't forget the importance of practice! The more time you spend practicing your creative processes, the better equipped you will be for anything that comes your way – whether it's creating new ideas or finishing projects.
