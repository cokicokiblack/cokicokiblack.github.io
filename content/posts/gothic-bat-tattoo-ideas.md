Invention: A Process
Invention is a process. It involves coming up with a new idea, working on it until it’s perfected, and then bringing that idea to the world. There are many different ways to come up with ideas, but the key is to keep working on it until you have an invention that works. Inventors are always looking for ways to improve their inventions, and there are many different methods for doing this. One of the most common methods is brainstorming, which can help you come up with ideas for products or services. Other methods include developing a prototype, testing it out on people or animals, and seeing if anyone likes it. If you’re not sure how to come up with an invention, there are plenty of resources available online or in books to help you.

Outdoor projects: How to fix a broken window, install a new deck, or repaint your house.
If you're looking to fix a broken window or install a new deck, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some easy diy projects to get started:
1. Fix a Broken Window

One way to fix a broken window is to use your hands. Get some adhesive and put it on the inside of the windowpane. Once it's set, hold onto the edge of the adhesive and pull the window open. You could also use screws if the window frame is strong enough to hold itself together without help. If all of this doesn't work, call a professional!

2. Install a New Deck or Decking

Another option for fixing a broken window is to install new decking or railing. This can be done either in-home or at an outdoor location.
