Innovative thinking: How do we think differently to change things?
We all know that innovation is key to success in any business. But what does it mean when we talk about innovation?
Innovation can be defined as the process of designing, producing, and using a new product or service in order to improve the quality or usability of an existing product. There are many different ways to think about innovation, but four main themes will be used throughout this article:1) new ways of looking at old problems; 2) using technology to help solve problems; 3) breaking down barriers between ideas and reality; and 4) creating value for others. 

When you think about innovative thinking, you first need to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Instead, it’s important to explore different methods and concepts in order to find the most effective way to achieve your goals.

The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any person’s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.

what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.
