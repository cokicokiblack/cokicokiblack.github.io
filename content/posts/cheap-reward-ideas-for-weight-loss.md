The creative process: How does one go about creating something new?
Creativity is a process that some people enjoy and others find difficult. The creative process can be broken down into four main categories: 1) Brainstorming 2) Idea generation 3) Implementation 4) Delivery. In order to be creative, one must have an idea and be able to come up with creative ways to express that idea. Additionally, one must have the courage to take risks in order to create something new.

The Benefits of Creative Ideas: After hearing all of the benefits of creative ideas, it is clear why they are so important in business.
Creative ideas are important in business because they can help businesses create new and innovative products or services. Some of the benefits of creative ideas include: 
1. Increased Productivity – When a business has a good idea, they can often improve their productivity as they can better focus on what they are supposed to be doing. 
2. Improved Delight at Work – While some businesses may find it difficult to come up with creative ideas, creative thinking often leads to increased delight and satisfaction with work. This is due in part to the fact that creativity opens up new possibilities and helps businesses explore the potential of their products or services in a more interesting way than if they were just following pre-determined paths.
