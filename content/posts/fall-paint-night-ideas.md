Creativity is a nebulous term that can be defined in many ways. Many people believe that creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas, or to innovate in the way you work. Others may define creativity as being Gallup’s definition of creativity which states that “creativity refers to the power of ideas to influence reality.” In any case, it is important to understand what creativity truly is so that we can better understand how we can use it in our own lives and businesses.
