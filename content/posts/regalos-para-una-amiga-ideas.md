Creative process: How does creativity work?
Creativity is often thought of as a process, rather than an event. creativity begins with the idea, and then the creative artist goes on to create something unique and amazing from that idea. This creative process often includes brainstorming, designing, testing, refining, and sometimes even reworking ideas until they are finally created.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new and different, whether it be in the form of a product, service or technology. Innovation is essential to the growth and success of any company. By definition, innovation means "a sudden change in the way things are done." In other words, it's the ability to come up with new ideas that can improve a business' bottom line.
However, while innovation is important, it isn't everything a company needs to thrive. In fact, too much innovation can lead to paralysis by analysis, which can prevent a company from taking advantage of current opportunities or changing its strategy in response to new trends. To be successful in the world of business, it's important to focus on both innovation and execution – two separate but equally important aspects of being innovative.

Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or solution to a problem.

Inventions often come about when people come up with an idea that others may find valuable. Some inventions, such as the printing press, were developed for the purpose of helping people make money. Other inventions, such as the lightbulb, were created simply to make things better.
