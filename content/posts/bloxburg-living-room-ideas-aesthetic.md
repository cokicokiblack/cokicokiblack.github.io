The benefits to creativity: How does creativity help us achieve our goals?
Creativity is frequently seen as one of the biggest benefits to having a creative mind. It can help you achieve your goals more efficiently and effectively, and it can also help you develop new skills. Here are some of the most common reasons why creativity is so beneficial: 
1. It can increase brainstorming and problem-solving abilities.

When you have a lot of ideas floating around in your head, creativity can help you come up with a solution that's more likely to work. And when it comes to problem-solving, creativity can be an asset – it's often better than relying on pre-determined solutions. 

2. It can make you faster learners.

One of the best things about creativity is that it gives you the opportunity to learn quickly and assimilate new information.

What are the different ways to come up with ideas?
Let's face it, come up with ideas can be a challenge. But there are different ways to approach coming up with them. Here are three ways: 
1. Brainstorm with others: When you're stuck, brainstorm with other people to get their help. They might have a better idea than you do, and they might be more willing to share what they know.

2. Take a walk: Take a walk around your neighborhood or city to get new ideas for businesses or products. This can also lead you to places where you haven't thought of before.

3. Find an online course: If all else fails, take an online course on creativity in business or product design. This can help you learn how to come up with ideas from scratch and see how different techniques work in the real world.

Underlying drivers of innovation: The need for new information, technology, or business models
Innovation is what makes businesses and societies successful. It allows for new products, services, or ideas to be developed and offered to the public. However, without innovation, businesses can quickly lose their competitive edge and society can become more stagnant. There are several underlying drivers of innovation that must be considered if we want to see continued success for our industries and societies.
New information technology is vital for businesses in order to increase efficiency and innovate faster. Technologies like chatbots and AI have the potential to change how customers interact with businesses, making them more likely to choose a business over another option. By increasing efficiency and reducing customer friction, businesses can sell more products and services at a lower cost.

Technology also plays a vital role in the development of new business models.
