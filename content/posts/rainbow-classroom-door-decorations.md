Conclusion: The benefits of brainstroming are vast and varied, and it can have a profound impact on people’s lives.

Innovation is the process of change in a product or service. It can be defined as a new way of doing something, or an alteration in the way that something is done. Innovation can come from people or businesses, and it can happen in a number of different ways.
