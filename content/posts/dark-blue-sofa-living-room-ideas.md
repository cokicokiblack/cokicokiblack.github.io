How can it be implemented?
In many ways, the implementation of a new idea can be difficult. However, with a little creativity and perseverance, it can be done. Here are some ideas to get your new concept off the ground: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your product or service to do. What needs will it address? What are the benefits of using your product or service? These questions will help you to create a vision for your business and come up with a plan of how to make that happen. 
2. Once you have a vision, it's time to start planning how to achieve it. This can be done in many different ways, but one important step is creating an outline of how your business will operate and what products or services will be offered. This will help you develop marketing plans and identify where money should go in order to bring your vision to life.

The role of innovation in business:
Many businesses, including many small businesses, depend on innovation in order to remain competitive. Innovation can be defined as the application of new knowledge and ideas to solve a problem or increase efficiency in a business. Innovation is an essential part of business success, and small businesses especially need to be aware of how they can benefit from it.
There are several ways that small businesses can benefit from innovation, but the most important way is through increased efficiency. Efficiency is the ability of a business to produce goods and services efficiently using resources limited by cost or time. By increasing efficiency, small businesses can save money on their product or service offerings, which will then allow them to invest more in their other products and services. This increased investment will result in better customer service, higher profits, and more sustainable growth.

Increased innovation also leads to new product innovations.
