Conclusion: How does brainstorming work? How do you come up with great ideas? What makes good ones? Is there a difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions?
In any business, brainstorming is a process that often helps to come up with great ideas. It can be used as part of an overall strategy or as a standalone tool. The most important thing is to find the right way to use it and to make sure it’s effective. There are two main types of brainstorming: formal and informal. Formal brainstorming typically takes place in a group setting and is focused on coming up with specific solutions to problems. In contrast, informal brainstorming can take place in your own time and can be more creative. It can involve anything from talking about your ideas with friends to simply coming up with your thoughts on the matter at hand. While there’s no one way to do brainstorming, using both forms will help you come up with more innovative ways to solve problems and come up with better ideas.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?
