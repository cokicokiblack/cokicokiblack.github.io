It seems that creativity is a complex thing, and there is no one definition that fits everyone. However, what makes someone creative? Some people might say that creativity comes from being able to think outside the box, while others might say it comes from being able to think of new ideas or coming up with new solutions to old problems.

How do you come up with big ideas?
How do you come up with big ideas? There are a few methods that can be used to come up with big ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when you come up with a list of ideas and then try to come up with the best one. Another method is by doing mockups or prototypes, which are simulations of what an idea could look like. Finally, there’s coming up with solutions to problems, which can be anything from developing a new product to creating a new way of doing business. All of these methods can help you come up with some great ideas, but it all starts with having the right mindset and setting goals.
