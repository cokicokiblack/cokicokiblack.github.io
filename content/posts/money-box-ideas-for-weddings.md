Patenting: How do you patent an invention?
When patenting an invention, there are a few things to keep in mind. One is the idea behind the invention - what is it? Another is the protection that is granted by law - what kind of protection? And finally, how do you go about getting these protections in place? Here are some tips for each: 
- Do your research: Before you file a patent application, it's important to do your research and understand the different types of patents available. There are many different ways to protect an invention, so don't be afraid to start fielding questions from potential patentees about what they can and cannot do. 
- File early: filed early will help get your application filed on time and protected as soon as possible. If you wait too long, other applicants may have already filed their applications, causing your application to languish in the Patent Office for years.

Definition of Innovation: How can it be used in business?
Innovation is the process of designing, testing, and deploying new products or services that improve customer experience or competitive advantage. The word “innovation” has been used to describe everything from new products to better ways to do business.
There are a few key aspects to innovation that businesses should consider when implementing it in their business. One is that innovation should be based on solving customer problems and not just creating new products. Innovation can also come from developing new processes and technology, as well as expanding existing ones. Another key factor is whether the innovation will cannibalize current sales or help grow them. Finally, innovation must be cost effective in order to be worthwhile for businesses.

With all of these factors in mind, it can be difficult to know what type of innovation is best for your business.
