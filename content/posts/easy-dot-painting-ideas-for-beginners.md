Invention: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention has been a key feature of human history. From the development of tools and weapons to the invention of new transportation methods, innovation has always been a part of human culture. However, over time, innovation has become more complex and dynamic. Innovation can be described as the process by which new ideas, technologies, or business models are created. It encompasses everything from developing new products to creating new ways of doing business.
One example of this evolution is the development of technology. Technology has constantly changed over time and has helped increase efficiency in many industries. For example, airplane travel was originally difficult and expensive to achieve, but with the development of airplanes, people could now travel all over the world easily. The same can be said for computer programs and other technological developments. By changing how we use these technologies, we have increased their efficiencies and made them more available to everyone.

Air Quality Issues in Your Home: Some tips for improving air quality in your home.
If you're like most people, you probably take air quality seriously when it comes to your home. You might think about greening your home, getting a air purifier, or even simply getting a better air quality index rating. However, there are other ways to improve air quality in your home as well – some of which are easy and can be done without too much effort. Here are a few tips for improving air quality in your home: 
1) Make sure your windows are properly sealed. Poorly sealed windows allow harmful particles from the outside into the house and can cause respiratory problems.

2) Get a good air purifier. Air purifiers can help clean the air around you and reduce the amount of unhealthy ozone gas that is created by car engines and other sources.

3) Use proper ventilation!
