Creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative processes can vary in their specifics, but all involve the creative process of coming up with ideas, narrowing them down to a few that work well, and then implementing those ideas into a tangible form. Here are three examples of creative processes: 
1. Brainstorming: brainstorming is when people come up with new ideas without any specific constraints. This can be done in private or in group settings, and it's often used to come up with new ways to do something or improve on an existing product. 
2. Design: design is when a product or idea is created from scratch. It starts with the idea and then goes through various stages, including development, testing, and production. 
3. Programming: programming is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem or comes up with a new way to do something.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design that may not have been thought of before. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new plan for farming, or even something as complex as inventing a new type of engine. Inventions have helped people throughout history, and continue to do so today. Some of the most famous inventions include the Telephone, The Internet, and the car.
