Trends in computing: What new ways will information and communication technologies change the way we use and understand our world?
Technology has always had a huge impact on our lives. The development of information and communication technologies has led to a whole new level of interactivity and understanding between people and the world around them. Some of the most significant changes that will occur in this area are as follows:
1) New ways of communicating: Communication is now an integral part of everyday life, and it has changed immensely in the past few decades. Gone are the days where people communicated through written documents or talking with friends over weekly phone calls. These days, we communicate through digital platforms such as social media, text messages, and even emails. This allows us to be more connected to each other and share ideas and experiences at any time, anywhere.

2) A more globalized world: The globalization of the world has led to a more interconnected world economy.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).

Big Ideas are the driving force behind much of the progress that has been made throughout history. They are responsible for some of the greatest inventions, discoveries, and works of art. A Big Idea can be anything that inspires someone to think outside the box and come up with a new way of doing things. Sometimes, a Big Idea is something that seems so simple and obvious in hindsight, but it takes someone with a unique perspective to see it.
