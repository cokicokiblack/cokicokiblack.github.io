Trends in Technology: How will technology impact the future?
As the world moves forward, technology is likely to play an increasingly important role. Here are some ideas for what technology may mean for the future:
1. Robotics and artificial intelligence will continue to grow in importance. This will allow machines to do tasks that once required human beings, such as manufacturing and farming.

2. Virtual Reality could become more prevalent in society. This would allow people to experience different aspects of the world in a completely different way than they ever have before. It could also be used for training military and other professional roles.

3. The internet of things will continue to gain popularity. This means that devices will be able to connect with each other in order to provide services or content without either person having to leave their home.

4. New forms of energy may become popular, such as cryptocurrency and renewables like solar and wind power.

Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.
