Invention: What are its different forms?
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it is a new product or a new method of doing something. Inventions often differ in form, but they all share one common goal: to improve society. There are many different types of inventions, but the most common are products and methods. Product inventions are those that make something better than what was before, while method inventions involve coming up with a new way to do something.
