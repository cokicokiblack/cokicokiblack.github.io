Introduce the topic of ideas.
There are a lot of ideas out there. Some are good, and some are bad. But how do you know which ones are worth your time? In this article, we'll introduce the topic of ideas and explore some ways to tell if an idea is worth your time.
First, let's define what we mean by "idea." An idea is a potential solution to a problem or a new way of doing something. It's something that you can turn into reality with enough effort.

Not all ideas are created equal. Some ideas are better than others. To evaluate an idea, ask yourself these questions:

-Does this idea solve a real problem?
-Is this idea original?
-Is this idea feasible?
-Is this idea valuable?

Immigration and Customs Enforcement: What changes will need to be made to deal with this growing problem?
The number of people apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has increased by 50 percent in just five years, according to a report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The report also found that CBP is struggling with the increasing number of asylum seekers and refugees, as well as its own staffing shortages.
One solution to the problem may be to consider changes to how the agency handles immigration. One idea would be to relax requirements for criminal background checks on those seeking entry into the country, which can lead to more individuals being admitted without proper vetting. Another idea would be to increase funding for CBP so that it can properly patrol the country's borders and handle operations like search and seizure in more efficient ways.

How can we come up with big ideas?
One of the great things about being a creativity seeker is that you have all sorts of ways to get your ideas off the ground. You can brainstorm, come up with new concepts, or simply think outside the box. Here are a few tips on how to come up with big ideas:
1) Talk with other people: When you’re brainstorming, it can be helpful to talk with others. This will help you share your thoughts and get feedback. It can also help you create a group consensus on what should be done next.

2) Be open-minded: When it comes tobig ideas, it’s important not to be too tighten-lipped about what you want. If you’re hesitant or afraid of what might happen, it will likely stay bottled up inside and won’t lead to any big Ideas.

Definition: Innovation: the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing.
Innovation is the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing. It can refer to various aspects of technology, business, and creativity. Innovation often occurs when a company or individual discovers a new way to do something that earlier versions were unable to do. Additionally, innovation can come from the invention of a new product or idea. However, it is also possible for innovation to come from the development of a technology that was never before used in the industry. In both cases, innovation is a key factor in creating value for customers and shareholders alike.
