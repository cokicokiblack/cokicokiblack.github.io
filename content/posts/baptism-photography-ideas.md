Invention as Art: The History of Invention and the Perceptions of the World
Invention is a process of coming up with new ideas or novel concepts that often change the world. It is an important part of society and economy, and has been used for centuries to create new products, services and ways of life. Invention has also been used to define different eras in history, such as the ancient Greeks who invented wine and cheese, the Romans who pioneered engineering and artillery, and the Americans who created radios, automobiles and other technological innovations.
