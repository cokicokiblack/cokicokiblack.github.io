What is innovation?
Innovation is the creation of new ideas that replace or improve on the existing product, service, or system. Innovation can come from a small idea that’s implemented quickly, or it can come from a big idea that’s tackled in an effort to improve a whole product line. It can also come from the combination of two ideas, or from something new that isn’t even possible before. Innovation is something that every company needs to consider when they create their products and services.

Types of creativity:
Creativity is an act of thinking outside the box. It's the ability to come up with new ideas and solutions that don't always follow traditional procedures. 
There are many different types of creativity, but some are more common than others. Below are four examples of types of creativity that should be familiar to anyone who has ever tried them: 

1) brainstorming - This is when people come up with new ideas by brainstorming, which is where groups of people work together to come up with a solution.
2) problem solving - This is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem. It can be something as simple as fixing a car or solving a complex math problem.
3) creative visualization - This is when someone creates pictures or videos that help them think harder about how they want their product or project to look.
