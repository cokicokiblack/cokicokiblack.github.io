There are many people out there who need help, and even more people who need inspiration. It can be difficult to know what to do or say in order to offer them both. Here are six ideas for how you could help someone who needs it: 
1. Graphics: Draw a picture or write down a description of the problem or situation that the person is experiencing. This will provide some insight and direction for providing help. 
2. Words of Wisdom: Share your own experiences and advice with the person in question, or recommend books, articles, etc., that can help them out. This will give the person something to look forward to and may also inspire them further. 
3. Opinion: Share your thoughts on what the person should do or how they should go about solving their problem.
