What are the different types of art you can create? What is the difference between creative and non-creative art? Why is creativity important?
Creative art is often characterized by its unique and expressive elements. It can be considered to be an individual form of expression, or a way to express oneself. Non-creative art, on the other hand, is often based on the same parameters as creative art but does not typically have as much expressive power. It can be considered more bland or conventional.
