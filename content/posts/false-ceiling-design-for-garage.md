The scientific and technological revolutions: What did these change about the definition of invention?
Invention is a definition that has been in use for centuries.

The first of these was the introduction of the machine gun in the late eighteenth century. This change in technology allowed armies to fight on a much larger scale and made war possible for the first time. The second revolution was the development of computers in the late twentieth century.
