The benefits of brainstroming
A recent study has shown that brainstroming – a mental practice that helps improve focus and concentration – can have a number of benefits.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but they also come with risk. If your idea is too risky, it won’t get traction and may never see the light of day. That’s why it’s essential to be sure your idea is worth taking on. There are a few key principles that help make an idea a good one: It should be something people want or need; it should be novel and have potential to change the world; it should have a commercial Potential; and it should be feasible to execute. Here are three examples of ideas that researchers at Imperial College London say might just be worth pursuing: 
1. A contact lens that records what you see When contact lenses become more prevalent, many people will likely want to know what they’re looking at. This could lead to new ways for seeing the world and improving safety for everyone involved.

The Future of Housing: Will new technologies lead to more affordable housing?
New technologies that could lead to more affordable housing are being developed, such as blockchain technology. This technology can be used to create a digital ledger of housing transactions, which would make it easier for people to find and buy a place. Another potential application of blockchain is in the rental market, where leases could be recorded on an app and automatically renew without having to go through a human tenant.

The nature of creativity: How does it differ from other forms of thought?
Creativity is often considered to be a different form of thought than other forms of thought. This is because creativity involves the creation of new ideas and concepts that are not possible in other forms of thought. It is important to remember, though, that creativity does not require an empty mind or an expansive imagination. In fact, creativity can be developed through any type of activity that allows for thinking outside the box.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?
