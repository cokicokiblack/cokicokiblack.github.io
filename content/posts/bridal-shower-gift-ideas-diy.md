What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

Conclusion: What are some potential applications of brainstroming?
Brainstroming is a type of meditation that has been found to have many potential applications. In one study, participants were asked to focus on a specific object for 3 minutes. After the 3 minutes had passed, they were given a letter grade based on how much attention they had paid to the object throughout the session. The study found that those who had practiced brainstroming were more likely to receive an A than those who did not. Another study found that brainstroming was able to improve working memory in younger adults. It was also shown that practicing brainstroming improved mood and cognitive performance.
