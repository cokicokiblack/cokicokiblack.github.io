Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.

The power of creativity: how does creativity work?
Creativity is an intricate and often mysterious process that goes beyond the simple act of creating. It involves a deep understanding of the creative process, as well as the individual’s own personality and environment. This understanding can be gained through years of practice or by simply thinking about creativity in new ways.
There are many theories about creativity, but one that has been dominant for many years is the Creative Art Theory. This theory suggests that creativity comes from a combination of two things: the artist’s own ideas and the environment they are working in. The artist creates what they see and hear in their surroundings, then uses this information to create their own masterpiece. The environment also plays a role in creativity, by providing ideas and inspiration to the artist. When these two elements combine, it leads to a unique piece of art that can be enjoyed by anyone who visits it.

The power of creative ideas: How can they help your business or organization achieve success?
Creative ideas can help your business or organization achieve success in a variety of ways. By using creative ideas, you can increase the chances of success and create a more positive working environment. Here are six tips to help you find creative ideas that may be beneficial for your business or organization:
1. Allow yourself time to brainstorm. When you have an idea for a product or service, don’t immediately start creating prototypes. Give yourself time to think about it and come up with different options. This will help you get a better understanding of what the product or service can be and how it could be improved.

2. Talk to other businesses. Not all businesses are the same, so talking to other businesses will give you a better idea of what they’re doing and how they’ve been successful with their products or services.
