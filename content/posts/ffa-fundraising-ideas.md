Invention is the process of creating a new product or technology from scratch. It can be done through creativity, collaboration, and hard work. Some inventions are more famous than others, but no invention is without its challenges. For example, the peanut butter and jelly sandwich was invented by two men â€“ John Montagu and Charles Lindbergh â€“ and it took many years of research and countless attempts to perfect it.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are always something to think about and consider as you go about your day-to-day life. Whether itâ€™s coming up with a new idea for a product or service, or thinking of ways to make your business more efficient, big ideas are always important to consider. Here are some of the most popular big ideas around these days:
1. Start your own business: This is an option that many people take on because they feel like they donâ€™t have a lot of options available to them. The cost of starting your own business can be low, and there are many resources available online if you need help getting started. There is also the added benefit of not having anyone else telling you what to do.

How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.
