Creative process: In order to be creative one must have a passion for the work and be willing to put in the effort.
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but one of the most important things when trying to come up with new creative ideas is having a passion for the work you are undertaking. If you don’t have that same passion then it will be difficult to get started on any creative endeavors.

As long as you are willing to put in the effort, anything can be turned into a creative idea.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you can always count on. With the right mindset, any big idea can be turned into a successful business venture. So what are some of the most common big ideas? Here are five of the most common:
1. Start with something small. When you have a big goal in mind, it’s easier to focus on smaller steps that will make your dream a reality. This is especially true for businesses – by starting with something small, you can gradually increase your chances of achieving your larger goal.

2. Be persistent. If you want to achieve success, don’t give up until the end. Pounds saved every month will eventually lead to more money in your pocket and more customers coming through your door.
