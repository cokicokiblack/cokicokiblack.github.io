Contributions of invention: What has been done with invention that has changed the world?
Invention has had a profound impact on the world, from the creation of dishes that could be made without cookbooks to modern surgical tools and vehicles. Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time. Here are some of the most innovative inventions of all time:
1) The first electronic device was created in 1861 by George Stephenson and James Clerk Maxwell. This was known as the Manchester Electrician's Watch. It was used to tell time and helped people stay healthy during health epidemics like bubonic plague.

2) Invention of combustion engine in 1879 by John Fenton and Arthur Couch. This allowed cars to be driven on paved roads instead of being pulled by horses or carts.

Tools: How should you use the tools you have?
If you have a few tools that you like to use, it's important to know how to use them in order to get the most out of them. Here are four easy ways to use your tools the right way:
1) Make a toolset: When you have a few tools, it's better to make a toolset rather than purchase individual tools. This will save you time and money in the long run. A good starting point is an electronic toolkit, such as this one from Amazon. You can find other options here.

2) Use common sense: It's important not only to be able to use your tools but also be aware of what they do. If something doesn't work or doesn't seem right, try turning it around and using another tool instead.
