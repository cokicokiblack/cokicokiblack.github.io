The evaluation of ideas
Evaluating ideas is important in order to determine which are worth pursuing and which are not. There are a few key factors to consider when evaluating an idea:
- How original is the idea? If it's been done before, is it being done in a new or different way?
- Is the idea feasible? Can it be realistically implemented?
- What is the potential impact of the idea? Will it make a difference?
- How much support does the idea have? Are there people who believe in it and will help to make it happen?

A study published in the journal Cortex found that when people are brainstroming, they are more likely to come up with similar solutions to problems. The study was conducted by analyzing data from a study that looked at how people reacted when they were given different problems to solve and then later came up with solutions. While it is not clear why brainstroming occurs, the study found that it was associated with increased creativity and problem solving skills.
