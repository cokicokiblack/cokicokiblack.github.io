Invention stories are a common occurrence in history. Many inventions were born from the intersection of two or more different ideas and concepts. One invention might be a new way to do something, while another might be a more efficient way to do something. 
One example of an invention that was created from multiple ideas is the computer. Originally, computers were thought to be simple devices that could only do basic tasks like read and write.

The benefits of innovation
Innovation is a key aspect of business success. It allows businesses to improve their products and services, and provides them with new ideas for how to do things. In addition, innovation can help businesses capitalize on new technologies and updates to their own infrastructure. By improving the way that they use technology, businesses can save money and increase efficiency.
Innovation is also a key factor in creating jobs. By making improvements to their products or services, businesses can create new positions for people who are capable of doing work that once required an advanced degree or experience. Innovation also helps businesses increase production by making changes to their plants or methods of producing goods. In turn, this can lead to increased profits and more jobs overall.
