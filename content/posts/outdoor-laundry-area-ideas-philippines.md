In an effort to save the planet, many people are trying to devise new ways of living that do not rely on traditional methods of production. One such way is using green technology. 
One idea that has been gaining attention is the use of clean energy sources like solar and wind power. These sources provide clean energy that can be used to produce electricity without causing any pollution.
