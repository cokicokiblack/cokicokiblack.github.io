The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.

How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you?
How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you? There are a number of ways to do this, but one of the most effective methods is by asking yourself what interests you. This will help you to develop ideas based on what you care about, and it will also help to narrow down your options. The next step is to look through existing ideas and see which ones might be a good fit for you. Once you have narrowed down your options, itâ€™s time to start exploring them, by looking for examples and reading about them. Finally, keep in mind that not all ideas are created equal, so be prepared to test and experiment before making any decisions.
