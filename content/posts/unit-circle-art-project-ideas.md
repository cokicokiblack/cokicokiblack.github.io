Basic Home improvement projects: How to do them
When it comes to home improvement, there are many ways to do things. One way is to take a basic approach and do some projects yourself. This can save you time and money, as well as make your home look nicer in the process. Here are six basic home improvement projects to get you started:
1) Repair or replace broken windows: This is a simple project that can be done on your own. All you need is a screwdriver, some nails, and a drill. Once the windows have been fixed, all that remains is to paint them if desired.

2) Install a new heater: If your current heater isn’t performing as it should, it’s time to replace it. There are many models and brands available, so go with one that meets your needs. Installation will take only a few minutes once you have the tools needed.

Ideas for Art and Design: What are some possibilities?
Creative ideas abound when it comes to art and design. From something as simple as a new piece of jewelry to an elaborate design for a home, there are endless possibilities when it comes to both. Here are a few ideas that photographer and creative writer Damon Knight has come up with himself:
1. A series of prints of artwork made from recycled materials. This could be turned into an exhibit or displayed in a public space to inspire others to think about how they can make their own slice of the world by recycling.
2. A set of kinetic sculptures that react based on the movements of the viewer. This could be used as part of a public installation or display in a museum.3. A mixed media piece inspired by nature that is both beautiful and functional.
