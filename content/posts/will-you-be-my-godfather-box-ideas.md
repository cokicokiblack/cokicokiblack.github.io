Group brainstorming
Group brainstorming can be a powerful tool for coming up with invention ideas. By pooling the creative resources of a group of people, you can come up with ideas that you might never have thought of on your own.
To get the most out of group brainstorming, it's important to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. This means establishing ground rules that allow for open and honest discussion without judgement. Once you've established this safe space, encourage everyone to share their ideas freely. The more diverse the perspectives in the group, the better!

With a little creativity and some outside-the-box thinking, group brainstorming can be a great way to generate new invention ideas.
