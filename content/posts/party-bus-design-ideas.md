The definition of creativity: What is creativity?
Creativity is an important word. It has been used to describe many different things in the past, but its meaning has changed over time. In ancient Greece, creativity was defined as making something new. This idea wasn't widely accepted by people at that time, but it is still used today. In the modern world, creativity is often used to describe how something can be done or how something can be created. However, there is no one definition of creativity. There are many different ways to think about creativity, and each person has their own definition. Some people define creativity as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others may think of it as the ability to see things differently orto come up with unique solutions to problems. Still others may believe that creativity isn't about anything specific but simply creative thought and problem solving.

3) The Best Way
When you are looking for the best way to do something, it is always important to take your time and consider all of the options. There are many ways to do something, and it is important to find the one that will work best for you. Here are three examples of how taking your time can help you choose the best way to go about a task: 
-Consider what you want the final product to look like. Not everything needs to be done in one fell swoop, and there may be several steps that need to be taken in order for the project to come together. This will allow you to make sure that each step is executed perfectly and without any mistakes.

-Take your time planning out every step of the process. This will ensure that each step carries with it a certain level of importance and that there are no surprises along the way.
