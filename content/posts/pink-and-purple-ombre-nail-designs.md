Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
A new invention is always something to be celebrated. It's a sign that progress is being made and that people are still coming up with new and innovative ideas. But what happens when an invention goes wrong? When it doesn't work as intended or, even worse, causes harm?
There have been plenty of examples throughout history of inventions that have had disastrous consequences. The atomic bomb is perhaps the most famous example. Invented during World War II, it was used twice in combat, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

Other examples include the Ford Pinto, which was prone to exploding if involved in a rear-end collision, and the Segway, which has been involved in numerous accidents and injuries.
