What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.

How to be creative:
Creative art is a way to express yourself and connect with the world. There are many ways to be creative, and it all comes down to what you enjoy. Here are some tips on how to be more creative:
1. Find an outlet for your creativity. Whether it’s creating artwork, writing, or any other form of expression, find an outlet for your creativity. This can be anything from painting in your bedroom to drawing in a park by the waterfront.

2. Experiment with different mediums and techniques. If you’re stuck on what you want to create, experiment with different mediums and techniques. For example, if you’re a painter, try using oil or watercolors instead of pencils or crayons.
