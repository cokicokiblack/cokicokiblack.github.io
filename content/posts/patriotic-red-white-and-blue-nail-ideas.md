Invention as an event: What are some of the key steps in invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or idea. It can be something as simple as making a new recipe for cooking or designing a new shirt. The key to invention is coming up with an original concept that others can't come up with. There are many steps involved in coming up with a new product, but one of the most important is creating an idea. Once you have an idea, it's important to find someone who can help you develop it into a reality.

Conclusion: How to come up with big ideas and what they mean for your business or project.
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always apply: think outside the box, brainstorm, and be flexible. With that in mind, here are five tips on how to come up with big ideas for your business or project: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or project to achieve. What problems do you want to solve? What goals do you want to achieve? This will give you a good starting point for brainstorming ideas. 
2. Be open to other suggestions. When you’re brainstorming, don’t be afraid to take other people’s suggestions into account. If someone has an idea that sounds great but doesn’t quite fit your project, don’t be afraid to change it up a bit – after all, this is brainstorming!
