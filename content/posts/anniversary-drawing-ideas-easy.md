How does creativity work? How do artists create their unique works of art? What is the difference between creative and non-creative art?
Creativity is a complex and mysterious process that scientists still do not understand. Some artists say that creativity comes from the need to find a new way to approach an old problem. Creative people are often risk takers, and they often use their imagination to come up with ideas that might not have been thought of before. There are two types of creativity- creative art and non-creative art. Creative art is usually more time-consuming, but it can be rewarding because it can lead to new insights or ideas about the world. Non-creative art is less time-consuming, but it may not lead to new insights or ideas about the world.
