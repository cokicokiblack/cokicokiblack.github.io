How does creativity impact our lives: What impacts creativity in our day-to-day lives?
Creativity is an important part of our day-to-day lives. Whether it’s coming up with new ideas for a project or simply enjoying new perspectives, creativity impacts how we see the world and how we interact with others. Creative people are often seen as more innovative and resourceful than their less creative counterparts. In fact, according to a study by The Economist, the average creative person in the United Kingdom earns over £50,000 more than the average non-creative person. This implies that creativity does have a significant impact on our lives in ways that are beyond just creating new things.

The challenge of innovation: What are the challenges associated with innovative thinking?
Invention ideas are at the heart of most businesses and economies. They can provide new products or services that improve how people live, work, and play. But innovation can be a challenge, as it often requires fresh thinking and new ways of looking at old ideas. Here are some challenges associated with innovative thinking:
1) Finding the right balance – trying too hard to be different can backfire, leading to stagnation or even failure.

2) Facing the unknown – trying to invent something that has never been done before can be risky and time-consuming.

3) Working with others – collaborating with other teams and individuals can help speed up the process and create a more cohesive group.

4) Creating value – creating new products or services that offer value for customers is one of the most difficult aspects of innovation.

How to brainstorm effectively
It is important to know how to brainstorm effectively in order to get the most out of your ideas. Here are a few tips on how to do just that:
1. Relax and let your mind wander. The best ideas usually come when you’re not trying too hard to think of them. So take a break, go for a walk, or do something else that will help you relax.

2. Set some ground rules. Once you have a general idea of what you want to brainstorm about, it can be helpful to set some parameters for yourself. This will help keep your thoughts focused and prevent you from getting too sidetracked.

3. Write down everything that comes to mind. No matter how silly or irrelevant it may seem, write it down anyway.
