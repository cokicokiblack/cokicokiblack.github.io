The benefits of creativity: What are some of the most common reasons for its use?
Creativity has many benefits, including helping people solve problems, developing new ideas, and achieving success in their fields. There are many ways to use creativity, and each person has different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to using it. Here are five tips to help you get the most out of creativity: 
1. Have a clear goal. When you have a specific goal in mind, it will easier for you to find ways to reach that goal. If you don’t have a goal, you won’t be able to see any opportunities for creativity because there will be no structure or guidance to give you direction. 
2. Be open to new ideas. One of the best things about creativity is that it can take any idea and turn it into a solution.
