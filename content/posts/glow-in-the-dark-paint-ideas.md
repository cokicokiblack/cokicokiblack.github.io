brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.

Creative people often think about their work in terms of how it can contribute to the world. They may be visual, auditory, or touch based, but all creativity has in common is that it comes from within. Creative people are important not just because they can create things, but also because they can share their ideas and thoughts with others. Whether it’s through art, activism, or simply making new friends, creativity is essential for creating a better future.
