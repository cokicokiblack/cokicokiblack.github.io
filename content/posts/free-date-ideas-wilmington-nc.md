The Benefits of Innovation: Why are innovations successful? What are some common benefits?
Innovation is a process of exploring, testing and improving upon ideas. It has the potential to improve entire industries while making people's lives more comfortable and efficient. There are many benefits to innovation, including increased productivity, reduced costs, diverse product offerings and improved customer service.
There are several reasons why innovations are successful, but some of the most common are: 1) novelty – when something is different from what is already available, people tend to be interested in it; 2) risk-taking – when something is new and challenging, it can inspire people to take chances; 3) collaboration – when people are working together towards a common goal, they're more likely to come up with innovative solutions; 4) execution – ensuring that the innovation is implemented effectively can help increase its success rate.

Types of innovation: What are some types of innovations that businesses commonly use?
Innovation is a process of change that leads to the creation of new products, services, or economy. There are many different types of innovation, but four common types are product innovation, service innovation, market innovation, and business model innovation. 
Product Innovation: Product innovations are changes in the physical form of something that makes it more accessible or useful to consumers. For example, Google created Street View in order to allow people to see how their cities look from close up. This type of innovation is often used for education and marketing purposes. Service Innovation: Service innovations are changes in the way services are delivered to customers. For example, Apple Watch was developed as a way for people to keep track of their time and step-by-step exercises without having to carry a phone around. This type of innovation is often used for health and fitness applications.
