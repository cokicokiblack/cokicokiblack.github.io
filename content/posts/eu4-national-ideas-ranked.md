Definition of big ideas: What are some examples?
Big ideas are ideas that have the potential to change the world. They are often large and ambitious, but they can be implemented easily and quickly. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income: This idea would give everyone a fixed amount of money every month without any strings attached. It would help to lift people out of poverty and into a higher paying job.

2. A gender-neutral pronoun: This could be a huge political and social shift, as it would redefine what it means to be human. Additionally, it would help to break down many gender-based stereotypes.

3. A digital divide: This is a term that refers to the fact that many people in developed countries have more access to technology than those in developing countries. The digital divide has contributed to many social problems, such as inequality and poverty.
