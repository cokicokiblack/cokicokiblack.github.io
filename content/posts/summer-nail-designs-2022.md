Overcoming Obstacles: How to overcome obstacles that may prevent you from coming up with a great invention idea.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere, at any time. The key is to recognize them and act on them. However, there are some obstacles that may prevent you from coming up with a great invention idea. Here are a few tips on how to overcome those obstacles:
1) Don't be afraid to think outside the box. Sometimes the best ideas come from left field.

2) Talk to people who are knowledgeable about the area you're interested in. They may have some great insights that you hadn't considered before.

3) Don't get discouraged if your first few ideas aren't winners. Edison famously said that he didn't fail, he just found 10,000 ways that didn't work. Every "failure" brings you one step closer to success.

Explaining creativity in the arts: How does creativity work in the arts? Why do certain artists create different things and what is the difference between creative and non-creative art?
Creativity in the arts is a complex process that involves many different factors. One of the most important factors is inspiration. Inspiration comes from all around us and can be found in nature, literature, art, and any other form of creativity. However, inspiration cannot be used to create things that are not alreadyexisting. In order to create something new, someone must have an idea and then work on creating it until they reach a point where it is their own creation. This is called creativeigoration. There are many different types of creativity and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some artists prefer to use more traditional forms of creativity like brainstorming or problem solving in order to come up with new ideas, while others prefer more innovative methods such as appropriation or appropriationism. Ultimately, the key is to find what works best for you and let your creativity take over!
