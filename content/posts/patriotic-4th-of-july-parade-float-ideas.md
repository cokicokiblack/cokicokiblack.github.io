What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from something that has been existing before. Invention can be found in every day life, such as when you come up with a new recipe or idea for a business. However, invention can also be more complex and interesting, such as when you come up with a new way to do something that was done before but not so well. Invention is an important part of our economy and society, and it can provide us with new ideas and ways to improve our lives.

Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work. However, what we often don’t consider is how creativity manifests itself in our everyday lives. For example, when you go to a restaurant and see all of the different items on the menu, do you think about the creativity that went into designing and coming up with a plan for each dish? Or when you walk through your neighborhood and see all of the different houses, are you thinking about how much creativity went into picking out the right one for your home? In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.
