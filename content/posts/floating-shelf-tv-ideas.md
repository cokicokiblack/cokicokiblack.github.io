Creativity in art: How can it be used?
Creativity in art can be used in a variety of ways, from creating new and original pieces to exploring old ideas and techniques. There are a number of different methods that creative artists use to express themselves, and it ultimately depends on what the artist is looking for.

Basic Home improvement projects: How to do them
When it comes to home improvement, there are many ways to do things. One way is to take a basic approach and do some projects yourself. This can save you time and money, as well as make your home look nicer in the process. Here are six basic home improvement projects to get you started:
1) Repair or replace broken windows: This is a simple project that can be done on your own. All you need is a screwdriver, some nails, and a drill. Once the windows have been fixed, all that remains is to paint them if desired.

2) Install a new heater: If your current heater isn’t performing as it should, it’s time to replace it. There are many models and brands available, so go with one that meets your needs. Installation will take only a few minutes once you have the tools needed.
