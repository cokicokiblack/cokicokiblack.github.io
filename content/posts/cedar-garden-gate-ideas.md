Solution: How can we do it?
One potential solution to the migration of large numbers of people is to provide easier and faster access to the necessary visas and entry into the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has created a website that allows citizens of many countries, including China, India, and Russia, to apply for visas without having to go through a travel agent. This online system is known as the Visa Waiver Program. The program allows people from these countries to enter the United States for tourist or business purposes without first obtaining a visa. The website also offers information on how toapply for visas and what documents are needed in order to apply.

What are some common pitfalls whenbrainstroming?
There are a few common pitfalls that people fall into when brainstroming.1) thinking too much about what they want to achieve or understand. This can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which can in turn hinder productivity. It is important to remember that not everything needs to be done at once, and taking a step back can help clear your head and get back on track.
2) not specifically focusing on the task at hand. This can lead to people struggling with specific tasks or goals, which can make it hard to produce results. It is important to stay focused on the task at hand and set achievable goals rather than worrying about anything else outside of the task at hand.

3)procrastination.
