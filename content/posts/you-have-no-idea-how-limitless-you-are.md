How to generate Big Ideas: How do you generate big ideas?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to generate big ideas, but there are a few key things to keep in mind.

It doesn’t matter what type of idea you come up with – just be sure that it’s something that you can actually put into action and make a difference in your life.
