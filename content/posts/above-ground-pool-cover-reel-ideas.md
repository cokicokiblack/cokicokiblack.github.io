Definition of big ideas: What is it that you want your company to achieve?
When it comes to big ideas, there is no one right answer. Some companies achieve their goals by focusing on a few key areas while others have a more holistic approach. What matters most is that your company has initiatives that are meaningful and impactful. Definitions of big ideas can vary, but all should include at least one important factor: The potential for success. 
If you’re not sure what it means to have a big idea, ask yourself this question: How will your company benefit from developing this initiative? Once you know the answer, you can start brainstorming ways your business can use the product or service to achieve its goals.

Barriers to Innovation
Innovation is key to success in any field, yet it can be difficult to come by. There are a number of barriers that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a lack of knowledge, and a lack of creativity.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. This can include both financial resources and human resources. If you don't have the money to invest in new ideas or the people to execute them, it can be very difficult to bring about change.

Another barrier to innovation is a lack of knowledge. If you're not aware of what's possible or you don't understand how things work, it can be hard to come up with new ideas. This is why education and research are so important for promoting innovation.

Finally, a barrier to innovation can simply be a lack of creativity.
