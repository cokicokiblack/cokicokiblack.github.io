Definition of creativity: Come up with new and innovative ideas or concepts.
Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas or concepts. It can be found in many different realms, such as art, design, and business. In general, creativity is the process of coming up with new solutions to problems or making something new. For example, a creative artist might come up with a new way to represent a painting on canvas. A designer might come up with an innovative product that no one has ever thought of before. And a businessperson might come up with an innovative way to make their company more competitively priced.

Why are new ideas more important than ever before?
When it comes to new ideas, the stakes are high. They could be the next big thing, or just a passing fad. But if they're not taken seriously, they could quickly become irrelevant and forgotten. That's why it's so important to invest in new ideas – they could be the difference between a successful business and a failure.

The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.
