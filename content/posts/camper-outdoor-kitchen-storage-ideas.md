How creativity can be used in your work.
Creativity is key in any workplace. Whether it’s creating new ideas for products or services, coming up with solutions to problems, or simply coming up with new ways of doing things, creativity is essential to a successful organization.
But what if creativity wasn’t just reserved for the creative minds of artists and creatives? What if it was used in every day tasks, too? How could creativity be used in your work if you want it to be effective?

One way to use creativity in your work is by using problem solving as a tool. By thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems, you can help make your business more efficient and successful. And while using creativity in your everyday life may not sound as glamorous as being an artist or creative thinker, it can have major benefits at work.
