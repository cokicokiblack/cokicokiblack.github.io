The role of innovation in business:
Innovation is essential to businesses in today's competitive environment. By constantly developing new products and services, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive. However, there are a few key challenges that must be overcome in order for businesses to continue to innovate:1) It can be difficult to predict what will work and what won't in the market; 2) Some ideas may not be viable based on the company's current resources or past experience; 3) The novelty of a new product may wear off after a short period of time; 4) There may be some initial costs associated with innovation which can impact business margins; 5) Innovation often requires time and effort - particularly during the early stages of development; 6) Some aspects of innovation, such as customer service, may not match traditional expectations.

Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.
