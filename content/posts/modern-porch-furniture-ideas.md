What are some good ways to come up with ideas?
Ideas are one of the most important things a person can have. They can help you come up with new ideas for products, services, or anything else you might need to do. Here are some tips on how to come up with ideas:

2. Look at other people’s work and see how they have approached problem solving. This will give you a good idea of what works well for others and you can adapt it for your own business. 
3. Talk to other businesses and see how they approach coming up with ideas.
