How Invention began
Invention is a process of creating something new and often involving the use of an unknown or unusual tool. Many inventions have originated from the simplest concepts, such as a design for a shirt that was first conceived by a tailor. Other inventions, like the transistor, were created through years of trial and error before they were finally realized in devices such as radios and TVs. Inventions can be so important to our society that they are often consideredtreasures, and some have even been donated to universities or used in scientific research.

What are the benefits of implementing a big idea?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many potential benefits. From creating new ways of doing things to disrupting traditional markets, there are plenty of reasons to implement a big idea. But what are the key benefits? Here is a look at five of the most important ones:
1. Increased productivity and efficiency – Implementation of a big idea can lead to increased productivity and efficiency, as people can be more focused on the task at hand and less on their surroundings. This can result in increased profits and decreased costs, both for the business and its customers.
2. New ideas – One of the biggest benefits of implementing a big idea is that it opens up new possibilities for thinking and innovation. When people have more options available to them, they are more likely to come up with new ideas than before.
