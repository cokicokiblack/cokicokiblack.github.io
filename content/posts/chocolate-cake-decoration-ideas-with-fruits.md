In his book, Big Ideas: How to Think Big and Change the World, Michael Porter challenges the traditional thinking that big ideas are only possible in businesses with big profits.

Invention as a Tool for Progress
Invention has always been an important tool for progress. From the invention of the printing press to the development of the internet, invention has helped make societies and economies better. 
However, some inventors have argued that invention is not only a valuable tool, but it can also be used to hinder progress. For example, many people believe that the patent system is too slow and restrictive, which encourages innovation while hindering creativity. Others worry that Invention may eventually become a Replication Service instead of a Tool for Progress.

Regardless of whether or not inventions hinder progress, they remain an important part of human history and culture. In his book "Inventing the Future", John Seelye argues that innovation is essential to our future and that unless we encourage it, we will see stagnation and decline.

Discussing the definition of invention
Invention is a process of coming up with a new product or idea. This can be done through creative thinking, designing, or even just seeing an opportunity in the market and going for it. What makes something an invention? There are many different definitions out there, but the most common one is that it is a new idea that has not been tried before. So, if you come up with a new product or idea and you do not have any prior experience with it, you are considered an inventor.
