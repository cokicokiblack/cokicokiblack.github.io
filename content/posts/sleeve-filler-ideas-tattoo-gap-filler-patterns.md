Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Google’s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them. This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.

Conclusion: What are some things to keep in mind when coming up with big ideas?
When coming up with big ideas, it is important to keep in mind some key things. One of the most important things to remember when brainstorming ideas is that big ideas should be based on a specific problem or need that your business has. Additionally, it is also important to think about what you want your business to become. If you are not sure what you want your business to achieve, it is helpful to focus on smaller problems that can help you grow and improve your industry.
