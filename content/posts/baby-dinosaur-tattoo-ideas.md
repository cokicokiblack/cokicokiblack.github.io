How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you?
How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you? There are a number of ways to do this, but one of the most effective methods is by asking yourself what interests you. This will help you to develop ideas based on what you care about, and it will also help to narrow down your options. The next step is to look through existing ideas and see which ones might be a good fit for you. Once you have narrowed down your options, it’s time to start exploring them, by looking for examples and reading about them. Finally, keep in mind that not all ideas are created equal, so be prepared to test and experiment before making any decisions.

Trends in technology: How is technology changing?
Technology is constantly evolving, and with it, the way we live and work. In 2020, there are many ideas for how technology will change in the next year. Here are a few examples: 
- digitize everything: physical things will be digitized to the point where they can be stored and accessed from any device. This could include everything from your phone to your books. 
- AI will take over jobs: machines are starting to become smarter than people and can now do most tasks on their own. This could lead to layoffs in the workforce as companies adopt AI strategies to save money. 
- Virtual Reality will take over: our reality will be turned into a virtual one, allowing us to experience different worlds without ever leaving our home. This could have a number of implications, such as making travel more comfortable or increasing creativity.
