The art of collaboration: How do you work best with others to come up with creative ideas?
Collaboration is one of the most important aspects of any creative project. It allows for different ideas to be put together and can result in improved results. There are a few things to keep in mind when working with others, though, to make the most out of collaboration: 
1. Be willing to give up your own ideas - Collaborators need to be willing to take risks and put their own opinion aside if they want C-level projects to succeed. This doesn't always mean that everyone will like what comes out of it, but it's essential that everyone is on board with the project before anything gets started.

2. Be open to feedback - Collaborators need to be willing to give constructive feedback if they want their work to improve or simply be heard.
