3.1 What are some potential steps we can take to get started on finding a solution to our problem?
The problem we are trying to solve can seem daunting and difficult, but with some creativity and effort, it is possible to find a solution. There are a number of steps that can be taken in order to get started on finding a solution, and these steps will vary depending on the problem at hand. Some possible steps include: 
1.starting with an idea – when there is no clear solution as to what the problem may be, it is often best to start by brainstorming potential solutions. This can involve thinking about what could go wrong or how something could be improved, and from this, you may be able to come up with ideas for fixing the issue. 
2.finding collaborators – once you have some ideas for fixes or solutions, it is important to find collaborators who are familiar with the subject matter or who might have other ideas that would work better.

The definition of brainstroming: how it works and what it can do for you
There are many definitions of brainstroming, but the most complete one I’ve found is this: “the process by which a person or organization achieves a goal by using whatever resources they have at hand, including their own brainpower and energy.” Brainstroming can be used for personal or professional purposes. For example, if you want to improve your thinking skills, you may use brainstroming to do so. If you want to become more organized, you may use brainstroming to help with that. And if you want to achieve a goal faster, you may use brainstroming to help with that as well.

This can be useful for problem solving, memory consolidation, and more.
