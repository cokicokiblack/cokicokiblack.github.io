Requirements for innovation
Innovation is essential to the success of businesses and societies. However, some challenges companies face when it comes to innovation include:
-Lack of creativity: Many companies find it difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due in part to the rigid methods that are typically used in business. For example, most businesses have a traditional model where products are produced one after the other. This system limits the potential for creativity and producesfewer new ideas.

-Disruption: When a new idea comes along, many companies are hesitant to adopt it because they think it would be too expensive or hard to replicate. However, disruption is often what allows businesses to take risks and innovate new models.
