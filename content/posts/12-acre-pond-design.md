What is creative art and why should we care?
Creative art is a form of art that is inspired by or based on imagination or creativity. It can be considered an expression of ideas and feelings, and can be used to communicate with others or to entertain oneself. There are many different kinds of creative art, but the most popular ones are painting, sculpture, photography, music, and poetry. Creative artists often use their creative abilities to express their own thoughts and feelings, and to make something that is unique and beautiful. There are many reasons why people should care about creative art, and they include the following:

How can people start thinking about new ideas?
Most people think of ideas when they are brainstorming, but there are other ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective. Here are three tips to help you get started: 
1. Give yourself time: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to allow yourself time to think about them. Don’t try to come up with any ideas in an instant. Take your time and consider everything that you have said before coming up with a new idea. 

2. Be open-minded: Once you have considered some potential ideas, it’s important that you be open-minded about them. If something doesn’t sound right or feels too farfetched, don’t be afraid to change your mind after thinking about it more. Remember that every idea has at least one potential application.
