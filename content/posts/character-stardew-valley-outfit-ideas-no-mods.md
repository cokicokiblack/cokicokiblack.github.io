Conclusion: What is invention? How important is it? Why has it been so important in human history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to write and ideas have been able to spread. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or solution, which can be used to improve something that someone else has created. Inventions have helped people achieve success in a variety of fields, from technology to medicine. In recent years, however, invention has come under fire from some who argue that it is an important part of plagiarism and creativity. Though there are some merits to Invention, it is important to understand its importance before making any decisions about its use in human history.
