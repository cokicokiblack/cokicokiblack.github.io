Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.

Invention: The impact of invention on the economy
Invention has a profound impact on the economy. It could be said that without invention, there would be no modern day economy. Invention is the result of creativity and hard work, and it can have a significant impact on business and society. There are many different types of invention, but some of the most common are motorcycles, cars, laptops, and artificial intelligence. Each type of invention has its own unique benefits and drawbacks. For example, motorcycles are great for transportation because they're fast and easy to ride. However, they're not very good at getting people around in city streets or highways. Car manufacturers have been able to create more efficient cars by adding features such as automatic braking and air conditioning. This makes them much easier to use than other vehicles, but they also tend to be more expensive than others.

Invention process: How do inventors create new ideas?
Invention processes vary depending on the type of invention, and how new ideas are created. Some common methods include brainstorming, R&D, and ideation. Inventors often use different methods to create new ideas.
 brainstorming is a process where inventors come up with new ideas by thinking about what they don't know. The inventors can use any tool to help them come up with new ideas- such as paper, pencils, or a computer.

R&D is another name for brainstorming. It involves researching what other people have done and finding potential problems that could be solved by using a certain idea. This can take place in the form of studies or prototypes.

Ideation is another way to create new ideas. It's when inventors think about things that have never been thought of before and come up with possible solutions to problems.
