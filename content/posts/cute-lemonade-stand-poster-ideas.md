Patenting an invention: How to protect your invention
Patenting an invention can be a difficult process, but there are a few key steps to take to protect your invention. first, make sure the invention is properly registered with the USPTO. If you have not already done so, you should also create and submit a USPTO application for patent protection. second, make sure your invention is covered by copyright law. If your invention falls under copyright law, you will need to obtain permission from the copyright holder to use their copyrighted work in your product or service. Finally, always keep in mind that patenting an invention does not protect your idea from being copied and/or used by others.
