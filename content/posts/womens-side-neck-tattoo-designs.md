How to develop big ideas
The art of big ideas is key to any business. The ability to come up with original and exciting concepts that can help your company grow is what makes the business world so fascinating. Here are a few tips on how to develop big ideas:
1. Don’t be afraid to ask for help – There’s no shame in asking for help from outside of your company if you don’t have an idea that seems impossible. If you have a great idea, but don’t know where to start, speak with friends, family, or colleagues about your idea. They may have some great advice on how to get started.

2. Get organized – Once you have a good idea, it helps to organize it in some way so that you can better focus on developing it.

Creative process: How does creative thinking happen?
Creative thinking is a process that starts with the idea and then it's refined into a creation. It can be something as simple as an idea for a new product or just a new way of looking at an old problem. Sometimes, the creative process can involve working on different versions of the same idea until one comes to mind that you're inspired to produce.
