Creativity as a craft: How can it be used in your life?
Creativity is a craft that can be used in many ways in life. Whether it’s coming up with new ideas for products or services, or simply coming up with new ways to approach problems, creativity is an essential tool for anyone. For example, if you’re a graphic designer, creativity can be used to come up with new designs for advertisements or even just the basic design for a website. On the other hand, if you’re a musician, creativity can be used to come up with new songs or concepts for albums. In any case, creativity is something that should always be taken advantage of and used in any way possible.

Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.
