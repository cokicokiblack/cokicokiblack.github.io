What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to taking the opposite approach to an existing idea and seeing what happens. Sometimes these ideas can come from simply thinking about something different and seeing what comes out. There are so many creative ideas out there it's hard to know where to start! Here are a few examples: 
1. Try a new perspective on an old problem. When you look at something from a different angle, often the solution is obvious but you may not have thought of it before. This is where creativity comes in – trying things that others may have thought of as impossible or not worth trying. 
2. Make something that no one has ever done before. Something that is different but also traditional or familiar enough so people can feel comfortable with using it.

The 4 Types of Ideas: Objectives: What is the end goal? Creative: How do you come up with the idea? Imaginary: What could be possible? Fantastical: Is this really happening or is it a dream? Practical: How would this work in reality? futuristic: What if this happened in the future?
Ideas are a necessary part of any business or project. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems or to create new ideas. However, they can also be used for evil purposes. Some people use ideas as tools to manipulate others, while others use them as vehicles for their own creativity. 
The different types of objectives you might come up with in order to create an idea are imaginary, fantastic, and possible. Imaginary objectives are where you forget the end goal or what the final outcome will be. Fantastical objectives are where you think about things that couldn’t actually happen but could still make senses if done in a certain way.
