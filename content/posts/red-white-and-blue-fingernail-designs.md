Dark Side of the Coin: How can we make sure that our happiness doesn't come at a cost?
What does the dark side of the coin mean for happiness?
Some people might say that there is a cost to happiness, and this cost can be significant. For example, when people are unhappy, they may spend less money on goods and services, or they may reduce their social engagement. This could lead to a decrease in overall well-being.
There are also costs associated with being happy. For example, people who are happier tend to have healthier lifestyles and have fewer health problems. They also tend to enjoy life more and feel closer to others. These benefits could last for a long time if done consistently.
Many experts agree that there is a cost to happiness, but they differ on how large it may be.
