What is the definition of invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or service that never existed before. Invention can come from anything, from a simple idea to a novel technology. Some inventions are so important that they have led to entire industries, such as antibiotics and jet engines. Others are more mundane, like improved rice varieties or new ways to store gasoline. Regardless of the invention's importance, it is always amazing when someone comes up with a new way to do something.

Tips for Building a Better Home: How can you go about doing this?
One way to improve your home is by taking on some DIY projects. There are a variety of ways to go about this, so it really comes down to what you're interested in and what's available to you. Here are some tips for improving your home: 
2) Check out home improvement stores before starting any project. Not all stores carry the same tools and supplies, so you'll need to do some research before beginning any project. Look for stores that specialize in particular types of repairs or enhancements, like ad-hoc woodworking or electrical work. 
3) Get a good localpenter if you can't find the supplies or know someone who can help you out. A good localpenter will be able to help with everything from fixing dents in walls to installing new flooring or window trimming.
