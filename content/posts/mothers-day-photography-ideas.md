The artist as creator: How does the artist create their art?
Creative artists create their art through a variety of mediums and techniques. They use their creative juices to express themselves, and often work in collaboration with others to produce unique pieces of art.

Whatever the creative process is, it involves some kind of brainstorming or problem solving. Once you've come up with a few ideas, it's important to work on those ideas until you have a good one. And then it's onto the next step - finding a way to put those ideas into action.

Future of work: What ways will technology impact the way we work?
Technology is constantly evolving, so the future of work is always in question. Some ideas that could impact the way we work include:1) Virtual assistant technology – This could eventually allow people to work remotely and then receive help when they need it.2) Augmented reality – This could be used to improve efficiency by giving employees more information at a glance.3) Artificial intelligence – This is being developed to help with tasks that are too difficult or time-consuming for humans to do.4) Robot assistants – These can be used for tasks that are too dangerous or time- consuming for humans to do, such as cleaning or laundry.5) Driverless cars – These cars don’t have drivers, so employees would no longer have to worry about getting lost in the traffic.6) Collaborative working environment – This would involve employees working together towards a common goal instead of individually.
