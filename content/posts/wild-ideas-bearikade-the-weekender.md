How do we create innovation?
Innovation is a process of thought, creativity and change that occurs in any company. It can be found in everything from the smallest idea to the biggest product. To create innovation, it’s important to have a clear definition of what you want your product or service to achieve, as well as how you plan on achieving it. Additionally, it’s essential to have a clear vision for the future and how your product or service will help make that vision a reality.
