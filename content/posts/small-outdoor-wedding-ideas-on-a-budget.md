How to get started with creative ideas: What should you do first?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or creative project. However, getting started can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Look at your goals 
First, ask yourself what kind of creativity you want to achieve. Do you want to create new ideas, or simply improve on old ones? If your answer is "both," look for ways to combine your two skills. Are you interested in creating products, services, or designs? Then look into Lynda.com and online resources such as Illustrator and Photoshop for help.
2. Get organized 
Once you have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, it's time to start thinking about how to achieve it. Try creating a timeline/schedule for your project and working with someone else who can help guide you along the way.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to taking the opposite approach to an existing idea and seeing what happens. Sometimes these ideas can come from simply thinking about something different and seeing what comes out. There are so many creative ideas out there it's hard to know where to start! Here are a few examples: 
1. Try a new perspective on an old problem. When you look at something from a different angle, often the solution is obvious but you may not have thought of it before. This is where creativity comes in – trying things that others may have thought of as impossible or not worth trying. 
2. Make something that no one has ever done before. Something that is different but also traditional or familiar enough so people can feel comfortable with using it.
