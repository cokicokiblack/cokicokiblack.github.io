What challenges does innovation face?
1. Innovation is faced with a number of challenges, including the challenge of meeting consumer demand while ensuring that products are safe and effective.
2. Innovation can also face challenges from producers and consumers alike, as well as from government agencies that may require new technology to meet specific goals or regulations.
