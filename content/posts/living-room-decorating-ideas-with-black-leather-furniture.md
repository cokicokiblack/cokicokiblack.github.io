Factors that influence the definition of a big idea
There are many factors that can influence the definition of a big idea. Some of these include the idea's popularity, its feasibility, and its novelty. Popularity is important because it can help to determine whether or not people are interested in the idea. Feasibility is important because it determines how easily the idea can be implemented. Its feasibility will also depend on whether or not someone has an understanding of the concept. Finally, novelty is important because it can change people's opinions on an issue. This can lead to a change in the way people think about the idea and potential implementation.
