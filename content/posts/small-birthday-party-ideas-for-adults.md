Human nature:
The phrase “human nature” has been used for centuries to describe different aspects of human behavior. In recent years, the phrase has come to be seen as a more general term that can refer to both individual humans and groups of humans. This idea is that human nature is unpredictable and complex, and it is difficult to predict what will happen in the future.

Invention and Technology- What is the difference?
There is a big difference between invention and technology. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, while technology is the use of that idea to make something happen. Invention can be anything from a simple solution to a complex product or service. Shelly Korman, an inventor and business owner, said that invention is the “f initest and simplest form of creativity.” It can be something as simple as coming up with an idea for a product or service, or coming up with a way to do something better than what someone else has done before. Technology, on the other hand, can be anything from making something work better than it ever has before to creating artificial intelligence (AI). There are so many different ways that technology can be used, and there is no one right way to use them all.

How to turn creative ideas into reality
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but sometimes they can turn into something really great. Here are four tips to help you turn your creative ideas into reality:
1. Have a vision. Without a clear vision, it’s tough to put together an idea that will work. Make sure your idea is based on something you care about and have passion for.

2. Get feedback. Take the time to get feedback from people who know what you’re talking about. Not only will this help you ensure your idea is accurate, but it can also give you some great ideas to work with.

3. Make it simple and achievable. If it’s too difficult or challenging to come up with an idea, chances are it won’t be successful.
