Trends in mobility: How is mobile technology affecting business and how will it impact the future of work?
Mobile technology is slowly but surely affecting business as more and more people move around the world. This has a big impact on the future of work, as businesses have to adapt to the needs of their customers who are increasingly using mobile devices for work purposes. Here are some ideas for how mobile technology will affect business in 2022:
1) The rise in mobile phone ownership: In 2020, over 50% of Australians had a mobile phone, up from just 25% in 2009. This has led to a big increase in the demand for data and voice services. As people becomemore reliant on their phones for work purposes, companies need to be prepared to offer good deals on data and voice rates.

2) The shift towards digital working: Technology has been gradually getting better at letting people collaborate through electronic means.

What is customer service and how do you provide it?
Customer service is a term that is often used interchangeably with customer relations. It refers to the various methods through which customers can interact with companies and receive the service they need. From calling in for a repair to speaking with a supervisor, there are many ways to get help from your company.
There are two main types of customer service: face-to-face and online. Face-to-face customer service allows customers to interact with employees directly. Online customer service is more common, but it can also be accessed from computers or devices. This type of customer service provides a variety of options for customers, including webinars, chat rooms, and social media platforms.

Both types of customer service have their own strengths and weaknesses.
