However, it's important to note that not everything comes from ideas. Sometimes, something has to be done before an idea can be a reality. This is where hard work comes in.

A brief history of the patent system: What is it?
The patent system, also known as the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patent system, is a system of intellectual property rights that allows businesses to protect their discoveries and innovations by awarding exclusive rights to those who make them. The patent system was first instituted in 1790, when the US Congress passed the Patent Act. The patent system has been amended multiple times over the years, but its fundamental structure remains unchanged. The USPTO administers a number of different types of patents, including utility patents, design patents, industrial design patents, and trade secrets.
