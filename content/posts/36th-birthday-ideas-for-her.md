Decorating: How can you make your home look its best without spending a fortune?
There are many ways to decorated your home without spending a fortune. You can buy new art or accessories or make your own decorations with materials you have on hand. Here are some ideas to help you get started: 
1. Decorate the walls with art. Paint the walls in different colors and designs, add pictures, or use products like spray paint to create an ethnic look.

3. Add plants and flowers to your home in any way possible. Not only will this add decoration, but it also makes the environment more welcoming and stress-free. 
4. Get creative with window treatments and draperies.
