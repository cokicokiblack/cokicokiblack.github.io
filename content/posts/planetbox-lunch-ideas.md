The role of innovation in business: What are some applications of innovation?
Innovation is a term that is often used in business to describe new ideas or methods that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a business. This can be achieved through technological innovations, business model changes, or even product design changes. In recent years, innovation has become more important in businesses as it has become more difficult for companies to stay afloat with traditional methods such as investment and marketing. One way that businesses can use innovation to their advantage is by using it to improve customer service. By taking advantage of new technologies and developing processes that are less time-consuming, businesses can save time and money on customer service.

The definition of creativity: What does it mean to be creative?
Creativity is the ability to produce new ideas or solutions that are unique and different from those that have been produced before. This may be seen as a natural talent or an acquired skill, but it is still creativity if it is used in an original way. The definition of creativity has changed over time, but the essentials remain the same: creativity involves using your own mind and imagination to come up with new ideas or solutions.
