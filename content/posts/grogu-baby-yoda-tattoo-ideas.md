Creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative processes can vary in their specifics, but all involve the creative process of coming up with ideas, narrowing them down to a few that work well, and then implementing those ideas into a tangible form. Here are three examples of creative processes: 
1. Brainstorming: brainstorming is when people come up with new ideas without any specific constraints. This can be done in private or in group settings, and it's often used to come up with new ways to do something or improve on an existing product. 
2. Design: design is when a product or idea is created from scratch. It starts with the idea and then goes through various stages, including development, testing, and production. 
3. Programming: programming is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem or comes up with a new way to do something.

The future of food: How will we consume food in the future?
The future of food is still in question, but some ideas that have been floated include: 1) meal delivery services such as Uber and Deliveroo; 2) eating out less often; and 3) growing more of our food in the home. 
While these are all plausible options, there is also the potential for even more niche or Sustainable eaters to emerge, who will only consume sustainable or earth-friendly products. So what does this mean for consumers? 

When it comes to food, it means looking out for not just sustainability but also flavor. If you want your food to taste good, it needs to be nutritious and fresh. Fresh produce tastes better and is more refreshing on the palate, so if you can find earth-friendly or sustainable options that do both, go for it!

5th idea:
There are a lot of great ideas out there. But sometimes, it can be hard to come up with new ones. Here are five ways to get those creative juices flowing:
1. Take a walk: Sometimes the best ideas come when you're not even trying to think of them. So go for a walk, and let your mind wander.

2. Talk to people: Talk to friends, family, and strangers about their interests and passions. You never know what might spark an idea in your own mind.

3. Doodle: Don't worry about trying to draw something perfect or beautiful. Just let your pencil roam across the paper, and see what shapes and patterns emerge.

4. Play with toys: Toys are designed to stimulate creativity in children. So why not adults? Get out some LEGOs or coloring books and see what you can create.
