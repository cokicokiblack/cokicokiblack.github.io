Why creativity is important
Creativity is important for a number of reasons. One reason is that creativity can help us come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. Additionally, creativity can help us communicate our ideas more effectively and move forward with projects. Finally, creativity can also lead to new ways of looking at old ideas and ways of doing things.

2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.

Ideas are the lifeblood of any innovation movement. They fuel new ideas, sparking new thinking, and driving progress. But like anything else in life, there are a finite number of ideas out there and it can be difficult to find them. That’s where open-source software comes in. Open-source software is a collaborative software development model where anyone can contribute an unfinished piece of codebase to help others build upon it.

Definition of a "new idea"
A new idea is a re-interpretation or expansion of an old concept that has been brought to a new level of understanding or application. This can be accomplished through thought, creativity, or a mixture of the two. New ideas are always in flux and are constantly being developed and tweaked as more information is learned and considered.
