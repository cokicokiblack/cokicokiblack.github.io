patenting inventions: What is the process of getting an invention patent?
There is the process of patenting inventions, which can be a long and difficult process. Patent applications must be filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). After an application is filed, the USPTO will review it and may ask for changes or modifications. If approved, the application will then be sent to a full-blown prosecution process. This can take several months or even years. Once the full-blown prosecution process is complete, an invention may be registered with the USPTO as a trademark, trade name, or other intellectual property.

What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.
