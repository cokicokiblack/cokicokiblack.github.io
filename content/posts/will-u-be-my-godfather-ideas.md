Posting ideas for art: How do you share your ideas with the world?
Creative art can be a great way to share your ideas with the world. By sharing your ideas, you can help other people become inspired and want to create their own pieces of art. There are many ways to share your creativity, and it really depends on what pleases you. If you're looking for ways to show off your skills, there are many ways to do that. However, if you're just looking for ideas, here are a few things that might come in handy: 
1) Draw or paint something that represents your idea of art. This could be something basic like a simple landscape or figure, or something more complex like an abstract painting. The important part is that it's creative and expresses your idea in some way. 
2) Share drawings or paintings online.
