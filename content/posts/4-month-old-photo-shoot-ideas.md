Patent protection: What are the different types of patent protection?
Patent protection is a type of intellectual property that helps to protect ideas and other creative works. There are many different types of patent protection, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Here is a list of the most common types of patent protection:
1) Patent for invention: This type of patent protects the idea behind an invention, rather than the specific products or services that are produced as a result. This type of protection can be helpful for businesses who want to protect their new ideas from potential competitors, but it can also be expensive to obtain.

2) Patent for trade secret: This type of patent protects a confidential business information, such as a recipe or design. This protection can be helpful for businesses who want to keep their secrets safe, but it can also be difficult to enforce.
