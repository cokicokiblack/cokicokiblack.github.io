The history of AI: How has AI been developed over the years?
A key part of any AI development is understanding the motivations behind the work. This history can be broken down into three periods: the1950s, 1970s, and 1980s. The 1950s were a time when AI was in its early developmental stages; however, it wasn’t until the 1960s that advancements began to occur in machine learning. However, this progress was slowed by two factors: the Cold War and concerns about how AI could be used for harm. The 1970s saw significant advancements made in AI; however, these advances were met with backlash from some quarters as they were seen as being too advanced for their time. The 1980s saw a shift towards using AI for good; however, this shift was met with criticism from some who felt that AI had become excessive in its power.

Creative process: What are the four steps?
Creative process is key to any creative endeavors. There are four steps that go into creating a masterpiece: 1) Defining the problem or goal. This will help you come up with a strong plan of how you will solve the problem, 2) Crafting the solution or idea. This can be done through brainstorming, exploring different options, and formulating a proposal. 3) Testing and refining the solution or idea. This can involve working on it for hours, weekends, or even weeks until it’s ready for submission to an audience. 4) Sending the solution or idea off to be created by others. Once it’s created by someone else, it needs to be edited, improved upon, and finalized before being published online or as a final product.
