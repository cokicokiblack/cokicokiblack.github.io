What are some creative ideas?
Creativity is something that everyone has in them. Whether it's coming up with new ideas for a project, or just coming up with new ways to see things, creativity is always a good thing. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1) Use color to bring life to your designs. Add a splash of color to any design and it will look more interesting and realistic. 
2) Think outside the box and come up with different solutions for problems. Remove the usual constraints and see how you can solve a problem in a creative way. 
3) Take risks and experiment with new technologies. When you're working on a project, it's important not to be afraid of making mistakes. risked experimenting with new technologies can lead to better results than simply following conventional wisdom.
