Invention is a process of coming up with an original solution to a problem. In many cases, innovation happens when people come up with new ways to do something that had been done before. Sometimes, invention can be something as simple as creating a new type of fuel or product. There are many different types of inventions, but the key word to remember is that they all have the potential to make life easier or more effective.

Conclusion
In the past few years, the idea of a virtual reality headset has become more and more popular. Some people use it for gaming, others use it to watch movies or TV shows, but most people are just getting started with this technology.

The history of invention ideas: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention ideas have changed over time, and as a result, the history of Invention Ideas is reflective of that. One way invention ideas have changed is in how they are created.  In the past, invention ideas were often based on scientific understanding at the time they were conceived. However, as technology advances and new knowledge becomes available, more and more innovation ideas are born from scratch. This new creativity allows for faster response tochanging needs and developments in technology.
One example of this new creativity is the cellular phone. Cellular phones were first invented back in 1984 by American scientist Neil Armstrong and his colleague Rick Stratham. The telephone was originally designed to be a basic communication resource for soldiers in war-time. However, after seeing how useful cellular phones could be for civilians, Armstrong and Stratham decided to create a product that could be used by everyone including business people and everyday citizens.
