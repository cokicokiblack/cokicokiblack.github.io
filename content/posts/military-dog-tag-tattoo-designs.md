Conclusion: ideas for making your home more comfortable and efficient
There are a variety of ways to make your home more comfortable and efficient. Here are some ideas: 
1. Make your home more spacious. A small space can make you feel cramped, and a larger one can make you feel cramped and separate from the outside world. Make your home as spacious as possible by enlarging the size of everything in it, including your kitchen, living room, and bedroom.

2. Add natural light into dark rooms. Add light fixtures that cast a warm glow in all of your rooms, rather than just in the areas where you want it brightest. This will help you feel happier and more relaxed in them.

3. Use less noisy appliances. Keep your appliances as quiet as possible by using those that emit very little sound or none at all.
