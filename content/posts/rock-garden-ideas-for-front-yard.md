Overcoming Obstacles to Innovation
Innovation is critical to the success of any business, yet it can be difficult to achieve. There are a number of obstacles that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a fear of change, and a lack of creativity. However, there are ways to overcome these obstacles and create an environment that is conducive to innovation.
By identifying the obstacles that are standing in the way of innovation, businesses can take steps to remove them. One of the most common obstacles is a lack of resources. This can be addressed by allocating more funding to research and development or by partnering with other companies that have the resources needed.

Another obstacle that can impede innovation is a fear of change. This may be due to a reluctance to embrace new technologies or a fear that change will lead to disruptions in the business.

Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.
