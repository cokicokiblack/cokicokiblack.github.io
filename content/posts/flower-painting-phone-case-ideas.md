This could include reading articles, listening to podcast episodes, or consulting with other business professionals. 3. define what you want your idea to achieve. Make sure this is clear and concise so you can focus on creating a great plan for making it happen. 4. come up with some specific examples of what you imagine your idea might look like and how it would help someone or something else. 5. come up with a timeline for when you expect to see results from your idea and how much money or time will be required in order for that to happen
