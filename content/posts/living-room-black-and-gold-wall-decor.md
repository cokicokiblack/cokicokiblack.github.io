Creative artists: How many there are and what makes them special?
Creative artists are an often overlooked but important part of the art world. They come from many different backgrounds and have a range of different skills and techniques. Some are able to use their creative abilities to create beautiful or powerful artwork, while others specialize in specific genres or styles. However, all artists have something special that sets them apart from other artists. Here are four examples: 
Allison Bechdel is a well-known cartoonist who specializes in creation of humorous strips about female characters, which has made her one of the most recognizable and popular comic book authors of all time; performance artist Grant Wood created memorable posters and paintings during the Depression era that stand as benchmarks for American artistry; and David Stone Martin is known for his dramatic story-telling with his unique use of sound and light.

Conclusion
There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas. Some people keep a running list of things that annoy them, looking for patterns or problems that can be solved. Others look at existing products and try to come up with ways to improve them.
 Brainstorming with friends or family can also be a great way to generate new ideas. And sometimes, the best ideas come when you least expect it—in the shower, while you’re driving, or right before you fall asleep.

The important thing is to stay open to new ideas and be willing to experiment. You never know when that next great invention idea will strike!
