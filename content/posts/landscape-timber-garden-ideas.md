What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything – a new way of looking at something, coming up with new ways to do something, or coming up with a new idea for a product. There are so many creative ideas out there that it can be hard to know what to choose from. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1) Get inspired by your surroundings. When you're looking for creative ideas, take in the environment around you and try to come up with some ideas for products that would reflect the atmosphere. 
2) Be open to change. If you're not sure what you want your product to look like, don't be afraid to experiment and see what different styles work well for you. 
3) Take time for yourself. It's important to spend time relaxing and focusing on your creativity instead of working on things that are taking up your time.

The history and definition of creative art: Creative art can be defined as any art which is created with the intention to communicate a message or create a piece that has a unique aesthetic.
Creative art has been around for centuries, and has gradually evolved over time. Initially, creative art was only used for religious or spiritual purposes, but as time passed it became increasingly common to see creative art used in everyday life. Today, creative art is widely accepted and enjoyed by all. There are many different types of creative art, and each has its own unique abilities and benefits.
One of the most important factors in determining whether or not creativity is present in any given piece of creative art is the artist’s intention. If an artist is simply trying to communicate a message or create an experience that is enjoyable, then their work will likely be considered creative. However, if the artist is trying to create something that is new and exciting, then their work will likely fall into the category of creative art.
