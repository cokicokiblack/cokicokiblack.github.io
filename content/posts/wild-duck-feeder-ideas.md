What are some common pitfalls whenbrainstroming?
There are a few common pitfalls that people fall into when brainstroming.1) thinking too much about what they want to achieve or understand. This can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which can in turn hinder productivity. It is important to remember that not everything needs to be done at once, and taking a step back can help clear your head and get back on track.
2) not specifically focusing on the task at hand. This can lead to people struggling with specific tasks or goals, which can make it hard to produce results. It is important to stay focused on the task at hand and set achievable goals rather than worrying about anything else outside of the task at hand.

Definition of big idea: A creative or innovative idea that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
Big ideas are those that have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. There are many big ideas out there, but it can be tough to find the right one to bring about big results. Sometimes, just having an idea can help you achieve a much-needed goal. Here are five big ideas that could change the way you live and work: 
1. A “big data” platform that collects and analyzes vast amounts of data in order to provide insights for businesses and consumers. This would allow businesses to make better decisions faster, while consumers could gain access to information they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

Definition of invention:
Invention definitions vary by country, so it's important to define what an invention is before discussing it in further detail. In the United States, for example, an invention is a new product or service that has never been produced before. Inventions can be made from anything from scratch, to a variation on existing technology. They can even come from ideas someone had while brainstorming during their day job.
There are many different ways to define Invention when discussing it with others. However, the most common definition of an invention is something that has never been done before. This definition can be used to describe any new product or service you may come up with.
