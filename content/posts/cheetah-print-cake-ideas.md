Ideas for Creativity: What works and what doesn’t
Creativity is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. However, it can be difficult to know what works and what doesn't. Here are some ideas for creativity that may work for you: 
1. Keep a journal or diary to help you keep track of your ideas and progress. This can be a great way to tape your thoughts and ideas together so that you can revisit them later on. 
2. Use creative software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to create digital illustrations, designs, or logos. These tools allow you to take your ideas and turn them into reality! 
3. Take on challenging projects that will force you to rethink your methods and strategies. This can include working on projects that are outside of your comfort zone, submitting original work to competitions, or simply trying something new once again!

The Creative process: How do you go about creating creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a necessary part of any business. They can help businesses achieve their goals and increase profits. However, creating creative ideas isn't just easy; it takes time and effort. Here are four tips to help you go about creating creative ideas:
1. Take your time

One of the most important things to remember when creating creative ideas is that they should take a while to produce. This means that you should be patient in your pursuit of them. If you're not careful, your ideas may not come to fruition.

2. Be open to feedback

Another important thing to keep in mind when trying to create creative ideas is that there will always be someone who can offer valuable feedback. This means that you shouldn't shy away from seeking out advice or input from those who know more about your industry or product than you do.
