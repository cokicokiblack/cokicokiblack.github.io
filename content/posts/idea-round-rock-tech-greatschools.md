The history and definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. It can be defined in many ways, but one way to think about it is as a change in direction from the traditional. Innovation often comes from outside of the normal channels and processes that are used to solve problems. Innovation can also come from within the company itself, depending on the situation.
