Origins of innovation: How has it been developed over time?
Innovation is a process that starts with a problem and then comes up with a creative solution to it. It is the result of creativity and the willingness to learn from your mistakes. Innovation is a key factor in economic growth, according to some experts. The history of innovation can be traced back to ancient Greece, where thinkers such as Socrates and Aristotle were fighting for ideas that would improve society. In China, the first written mention of innovation can be found in an account from the 3rd century BC written by Lu Cang. In Japan, it was only after Emperor Taish≈ç made education compulsory in 1868 that people began to learn about innovation. In the 20th century, innovation was widely accepted by society and was considered part of the natural order of things. However, during World Wars II, there was a major shift in how innovation was viewed by both sides.

Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from other types of change?
Innovation is a new way of doing things, or a change in the way things are done. Innovation can apply to any type of business, but it's most common in the technology and business sectors.
Different types of innovation can have different effects on businesses. For example, change in product design can lead to increased sales; change in distribution methods can lead to new customer base; and change in customer service systems can create new opportunities for growth.

There are a number of factors that go into defining innovation, including the specific industry or sector where it's being applied, the goals for the innovation, and how well it's executed. There are also five main characteristics that define innovation: risk-taking, creative thinking, rapid response time, team collaboration, and systemic impact.
