The three Cs of creativity: Concept, Craft, and Color
Creativity is all about coming up with new and creative ways to approach a problem or achieve a goal. It can be found in everything from making art to designing costumes. In order for creativity to thrive, it needs two key components: concept and craft. Concept is the overall idea of what the piece will look like and how it will be used. Craft is the actual creation of the piece, from its conception to its completion. Finally, color is a critical factor in creating an effective work of art. By understanding these three components, creators can better focus on their creativity and produce pieces that are both unique and engaging.

The Benefits of Thinking Out Loud: How to get started
With so many things going on in our lives, it can be difficult to focus. It's easy to forget that we have the power to think and change the world. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
1) Get organized. When you're not focusing, it can be difficult to stay on track with your goals. Make a list of your top accomplishments and objective, and then find ways to achieve them through effort and planning. 
2) Take action. Sometimes all it takes is taking some action towards your objective- even if it's just writing down what you plan to do next. This will help keep you motivated as well as give yourself an idea of how far you've come already. 
3)「What if?」 Thinking about possibilities can help increase your confidence when making decisions.
