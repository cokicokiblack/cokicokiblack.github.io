How to have big ideas
In a world where we are constantly inundated with information, it can be hard to come up with big ideas. But, having big ideas is essential for innovation and progress. Here are a few ways to have big ideas:
1) Be curious and ask lots of questions. When you're curious about something, you're more likely to come up with new and interesting ideas about it. So, ask lots of questions and explore the things that interest you.

2) Be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. If you're always open to hearing other people's opinions and considering different points of view, you'll be more likely to have your own original thoughts on a subject.

3) Take time to daydream and let your mind wander. Sometimes the best way to come up with big ideas is simply to relax and let your mind wander.
