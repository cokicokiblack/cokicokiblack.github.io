Invention: How did one person come up with an idea that led to a new product or technology?
An inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for a new product or technology. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to cook food, or inventing a new alloy that can be used in metalworking. In some cases, an inventor may develop the idea while working on another project, and then take it further by working on the details until they come up with a product or technology that they think will be useful. Some inventors are also able to come up with ideas while they are away from their home country, or during off-hours at work.

How creativity is used in the creative process: creative drawings, paintings, poems, etc.
Creativity is a key component of the creative process. By using different creative methods, artists are able to come up with new ideas and solutions that can help them achieve their goals. For example, when creating a painting, a creative artist might use different colors to create a realistic scene. Similarly, when writing poetry, the writer may use alliteration or other forms of poetry to make the words seem more interesting. In both cases, the artist and writer are trying to find ways to express themselves through their art.
