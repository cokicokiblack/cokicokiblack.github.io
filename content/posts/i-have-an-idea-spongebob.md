Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or innovation that can solve a problem. Innovation can be used in business in many ways, from improving the efficiency of a business to creating new products or services. Here are some examples: 
1. Inexpensive home-theater systems could be replaced by more expensive models that use 3D projection technology to create an immersive experience. 
2. A company that produces respiratory masks could find new ways to market their products, such as using social media to reach more people in need and airing adverts on television stations across the United States. 
3. The production of chocolate could be improved by using insects as fermentation tanks instead of milk cows to make chocolate more nutritious and less costly.

How to choose the right tools for your job: A guide to the right tools for the job
Tools are an essential part of any job, but choosing the right ones can be difficult. Here are three tips to help make the process easier:
1. Do your research: in order to make the best choices, it’s important to do your research and familiarize yourself with the different tools available. This will help you determine which ones would be best for your specific needs.

2. Choose wisely: don’t overspend on tools if you don’t need them. Make sure you know what type of tool is best suited for each job, and when these won’t suffice, consider investing in a more affordable option.

3. Get creative: there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to tool choice, so experiment until you find what works best for you and your work environment.
