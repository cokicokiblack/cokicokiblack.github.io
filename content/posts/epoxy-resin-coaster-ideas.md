Conclusion: Sum up the main points of the article.
Creativity is not a talent that you are born with, it is a skill that can be learned. Anyone can be creative, it just takes some practice. Here are a few tips to help you get started:
1. Don't be afraid to experiment. Trying new things is the only way to find out what works for you.

2. Be open to new ideas. You never know where your next great idea will come from.

The four types of ideas: brainstorming, problem solving, creative writing, andPeak performance
Ideas can be thought of as a blank slate, which is why they are so powerful. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems, or to write creative works. However, Ideas should not be taken for granted- they can often be very challenging to achieve peak performance. Here are four tips for brainstorming and problem solving:
1. Be open to new ideas. Don't get too wrapped up in your own ideas and don't resist the urge to offer feedback. This will help you to develop better ideas and find better ways to solve problems.

2. Be realistic about what you're asking of your idea generation process. Don't try and create an idea that's too impossible or out of reach- let your creativity take over and see where it leads you!

3. Take time for reflection before starting the brainstorming process.
