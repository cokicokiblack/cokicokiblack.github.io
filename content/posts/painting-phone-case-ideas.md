Research: How to do research to find inventions that can be used.
Invention ideas are a plentiful resource for businesses. The word “invention” can be used to describe anything from a new product to a new way of doing something.

Creative Solution: How do I come up with creative ideas?
Creative solutions come in all shapes and sizes, but the key is to find the right one for your needs. Here are a few tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1. Get inspired by other projects you’ve worked on. When you see creative solutions that are similar to yours, it can be easy to come up with ideas. This way, you won’t have to spend hours brainstorming until you find the right solution.

2. Be open to new ideas. It can be hard to be creative when everything else around you is familiar and cookie-cutter. But don’t be afraid to submit new ideas if they seem interesting or if someone else has already created a similar solution.

3. Take your time. Don’t get wrapped up in too much hurry when it comes to coming up with creative solutions.
