History of innovation:
The history of innovation is filled with stories of people who have inspired and changed the way we live and work. Some of these innovative thinkers have had a lasting impact on society, while others have faded into obscurity. But all of them have left their mark on history in some way. Here are 5 examples.
1) Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the movable type press in 1455 led to the printing press and the rise of printing technology as an important part of modern society.

2) In 1876, Bell Labs invented the telephone, which made communication much more accessible than it had been before.

3) The internet was first created in 1972 by mathematician Alain Robert et al., which allowed for greater access to information and education than ever before.

The benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are vast. By taking the time to brainstorm, you allow yourself to explore all possible options and ideas for a project, task, or goal. This can lead to better decision making, improved efficiency, and increased creativity.
When you brainstorm, you also force yourself to think outside the box and come up with new and innovative ideas. This can spark creativity in other areas of your life as well. Brainstorming is a great way to get all your thoughts out on paper so you can see them clearly and make better decisions.

The Importance of Ideas: What makes them so important?
Ideas are what make up the foundation of any organization. They can be wrapped up in a few words, or they can be something larger that needs to be planned and executed in a complete way. Ideas need to be carefully considering before being implanted into an organization, as well as being developed for the long term. Without ideas, there would be no progress made in any business venture, regardless of its size or complexity.
