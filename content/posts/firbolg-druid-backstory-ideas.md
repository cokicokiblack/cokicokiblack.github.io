How to do brainstroming in your business: What are some tips?
Are you struggling to keep up with the ever-growing pace of business? If so, brainstroming may be the perfect solution for you. Brainstroming is a technique used in business that helps you stay focused and organized. Here are some tips on how to do it in your own business: 
1. Set goals and targets.

When you start brainstroming, it’s important to have specific goals and targets that you want to achieve. By setting these goals, you can ensure that your brainstroming efforts are directed towards achieving these rather than just talking about it without actually doing anything. 

2. Find a way to track progress.

One of the best ways to track progress during brainstroming is by using a goal tracker such as Goalilla or MorningStar.

What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new products, services, or ideas that are different from the ones that have been before. It can be called creative change, and it can happen in a number of ways: through product development (racting evidence to create a new product), market research (finding out what people want and need), or process improvement (making things easier or faster). Innovation is often about finding solutions to problems that people have never considered before.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.

The history of invention: from the ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers
Invention ideas have been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that they continue to be a part of our daily lives today. From ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers, some inventions have had a lasting impact on society and the world. Here are five examples:
1) The wheel was invented by the ancient Egyptians, who used it to move goods around their cities.

2) The telescope was invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, which allowed him to see things that were previously impossible to see.

3) The telephone was invented by Samuel Morse in 1876, which allowed people to communicate with one another without having to speak directly.

4) The computer was invented by Charles Babbage in 1871, which allowed people to create new ways of doing calculations.
