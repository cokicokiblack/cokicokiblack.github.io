The power of creative: why be creative?
Creativity is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. It allows us to see the world in new ways, to find solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable, and to connect with others in a deeper way.
Some people are naturally more creative than others, but that doesn’t mean that the rest of us can’t harness our own creativity. There are a number of things we can do to nurture our creativity, including:

- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.

- Be open-minded: Approaching life with curiosity and an open mind allows for greater creativity.

- Take risks: Creativity often requires taking risks and thinking outside the box.

So why not give it a try?

The benefits of having Big Ideas.
There are a number of benefits to having big ideas, from increasing creativity and innovation to improving productivity and motivation. Here are four ways in which big ideas can help you achieve your goals: 
1. By definition, a big idea is something that is much larger than what has been done before. This can help you think outside the box, and allow you to come up with new and exciting ideas that may not have been possible before. 
2. Big ideas can also be more challenging than average, which can give you an opportunity to see how far you can push yourself and try new things. This could mean that if you’re looking for a project to work on that’s both challenging and innovative, a big idea might be the perfect fit for you.
