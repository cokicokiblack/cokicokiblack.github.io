What is big ideas?
What is big ideas? Big ideas are the seeds of creativity that can change the course of history. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common- they are big enough to generate a response from the average person. Here are some tips on how to get started with big ideas: 
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you understand its potential and potential danger. 
2. Look for examples of what has worked before. This will give you a sense for what other people have done that has helped them achieve their goals. 
3. Ask yourself a question: What if? What would it be like if this were to happen? This will help you determine whether or not your idea is really worth pursuing.
