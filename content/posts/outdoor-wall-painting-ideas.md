Brainstorming:
1. When it comes to brainstorming for creative ideas, there are a few key things to keep in mind.
2. First, it’s important to have a clear goal in mind. What are you hoping to achieve with your brainstorming session?

3. Once you know what you want to accomplish, it’s time to start generating ideas. There are a few different methods you can use to do this, such as free association or listing.

4. Once you have a good list of ideas, it’s time to start narrowing them down. Start by eliminating any that are clearly not viable, then move on to evaluating the remaining options.

5. Ultimately, you want to choose the best idea or ideas from your brainstorming session and develop them further.
