Conclusion: Why should we be interested in innovation?
Innovation is an ever-growing field of science and technology that is changing the way we do things. It offers a new perspective on how to improve products, services and ideas. Innovation has the ability to change the course of history, and it’s important for businesses to be interested in it. Here are four reasons why innovation should be on businesses’ radar:
1) Innovation can create new opportunities: When companies explore new ways to produce or distribute their products or services, they can find new customers and potentially new markets. This can lead to increased profits and growth.

2) Innovation can save money: Innovation often leads to cost savings, which can help make businesses more profitable. For example, imagine a company that finds a way to produce a product without using traditional methods. This could lead to significant savings in production costs.

what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a group activity in which members of a team generate ideas and solutions to problems. The term was first coined by Alex Osborn, an advertising executive, in the 1940s. Brainstorming is often used in business settings as a way to encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. 
There are several different methods of brainstorming, but the most common is probably the round robin method, in which each team member takes turns sharing ideas. Other methods include free association, in which participants share ideas without restriction, and brainstorming with constraints, in which participants are given certain parameters within which to generate ideas. 

The effectiveness of brainstorming has been debated by some researchers, who argue that it can lead to conformity and pressure to conform to group norms.

There are many ideas out there, and it will be difficult to come up with a one-size-fits-all answer. Some people want us to go independent of oil, while others want us to reduce our CO2 emissions.
