what brainstorming is, how to do it
Brainstorming is a technique used to generate ideas for a project or problem. To brainstorm, you simply need to allow your mind to wander and come up with as many ideas as possible. There are no wrong answers in brainstorming, so don't worry about being too creative. Just let your thoughts flow and see where they take you.
To get started, find a quiet place where you can relax and focus on the task at hand. Then, set a timer for 10-15 minutes and start writing down whatever comes to mind. Don't worry about editing or critiquing your ideas at this stage; just let them flow freely. Once the timer goes off, you can start looking through your list of ideas and identifying which ones are the most promising.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make things better. From new ways to solve problems to coming up with unique ways of selling products, there are endless creative possibilities out there. Here are a few examples that might be of interest to you: 
1. A new way to use old materials – This is something that can often be creative and innovative. For example, some people create sculptures from old tires or cardboard. This not only uses the materials well but also creates an interesting final product. 
2. Using technology in a new way – Another great way to come up with creative ideas is to use technology in a different way than it usually is used. For example, some people create illuminated signs using lightbulbs implanted in the skin.
