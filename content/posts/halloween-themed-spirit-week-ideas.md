Creativity is an essential part of any creative artist’s process. The way a creative artist goes about creating work varies depending on the artist and their unique strengths and weaknesses. However, some basic steps that any creativeartist must take in order to create excellent work are as follows:
1. Determine what you want your work to be. This includes answering the question, “What does this piece of art represent for me?” After answering this question, you can begin to develop ideas for what your piece may look like or how it could be done.

The benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are vast. By taking the time to brainstorm, you allow yourself to explore all possible options and ideas for a project, task, or goal. This can lead to better decision making, improved efficiency, and increased creativity.
When you brainstorm, you also force yourself to think outside the box and come up with new and innovative ideas. This can spark creativity in other areas of your life as well. Brainstorming is a great way to get all your thoughts out on paper so you can see them clearly and make better decisions.

How to Make Your Home More Functional
Last year, I was faced with a unique challenge. My home was slowly being used less and less as my office became more and more. To keep up with the trend, I decided to create a few key functional pieces in my home that could help me get more done. Here are some tips on how to make your home more functional: 
1. Make an organized space - One of the most important things you can do to improve your productivity is make sure you have an organized space in which to work. This can be anything from a shelves of books on one side of the room to wires leading out of the windows for potential cable management purposes. 

2. Get rid of distractions - When it comes to working, it’s important to keep things as quiet and distraction-free as possible.
